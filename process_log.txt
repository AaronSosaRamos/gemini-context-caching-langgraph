And there was\nevening and there was morning, one day.\n6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it\ndivide the waters from the waters.\n7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the\nfirmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.\n8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was\nmorning, a second day.\n9 And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one\nplace, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.\n10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters\ncalled he Seas: and God saw that it was good.\n11 And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, [and]\nfruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon\nthe earth: and it was so.\n12 And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and\ntrees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind: and God saw\nthat it was good.\n13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.\n14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the\nday from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and\nyears:\n15 and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the\nearth: and it was so.\n16 And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the\nlesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also.\n17 And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,\n18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the\ndarkness: and God saw that it was good.\n19 And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.\n20 And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let\nbirds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.\n21 And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that\nmoveth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird\nafter its kind: and God saw that it was good.\n22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters\nin the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.\n23 And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.\n24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind,\ncattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it\nwas so.\n25 And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after\ntheir kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God\nsaw that it was good.\n26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them\nhave dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and\nover the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that\ncreepeth upon the earth.\n27 And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him;\nmale and female created he them.\n28 And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and\nreplenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea,\nand over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon\nthe earth.\n29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is\nupon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree\nyielding seed; to you it shall be for food:\n30 and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to\neverything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, [I have given]\nevery green herb for food: and it was so.\n31 And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And\nthere was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.\n\nChapter 2\n\n1 And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.\n2 And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested\non the seventh day from all his work which he had made.\n3 And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested\nfrom all his work which God had created and made.\n4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were\ncreated, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.\n5 And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had\nyet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and\nthere was not a man to till the ground;\n6 but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the\nground.\n7 And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his\nnostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\n8 And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man\nwhom he had formed.\n9 And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to\nthe sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden,\nand the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\n10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was\nparted, and became four heads.\n11 The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land\nof Havilah, where there is gold;\n12 and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.\n13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the\nwhole land of Cush.\n14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front\nof Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.\n15 And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it\nand to keep it.\n16 And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou\nmayest freely eat:\n17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it:\nfor in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\n18 And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will\nmake him a help meet for him.\n19 And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every\nbird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call\nthem: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name\nthereof.\n20 And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to\nevery beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help meet for him.\n21 And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and\nhe took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:\n22 and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and\nbrought her unto the man.\n23 And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she\nshall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.\n24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto\nhis wife: and they shall be one flesh.\n25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.\n\nChapter 3\n\n1 Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Jehovah God\nhad made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of\nany tree of the garden?\n2 And the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden\nwe may eat:\n3 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath\nsaid, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.\n4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:\n5 for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be\nopened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.\n6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a\ndelight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she\ntook of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with\nher, and he did eat.\n7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and\nthey sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.\n8 And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of\nthe day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah\nGod amongst the trees of the garden.\n9 And Jehovah God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou?\n10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was\nnaked; and I hid myself.\n11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree,\nwhereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?\n12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of\nthe tree, and I did eat.\n13 And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the\nwoman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\n14 And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed\nart thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly\nshalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:\n15 and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and\nher seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\n16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception;\nin pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband,\nand he shall rule over thee.\n17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy\nwife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt\nnot eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it\nall the days of thy life;\n18 thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the\nherb of the field;\n19 in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the\nground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt\nthou return.\n20 And the man called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all\nliving.\n21 And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed\nthem.\n22 And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good\nand evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of\nlife, and eat, and live for ever--\n23 therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the\nground from whence he was taken.\n24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the\nCherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of\nthe tree of life.\n\nChapter 4\n\n1 And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I\nhave gotten a man with [the help of] Jehovah.\n2 And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain\nwas a tiller of the ground.\n3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the\nground an offering unto Jehovah.\n4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat\nthereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering:\n5 but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth,\nand his countenance fell.\n6 And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance\nfallen?\n7 If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin\ncoucheth at the door; and unto thee shall be its desire; but do thou rule over\nit.\n8 And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the\nfield, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.\n9 And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know\nnot: am I my brother's keeper?\n10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth\nunto me from the ground.\n11 And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to\nreceive thy brother's blood from thy hand;\n12 when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its\nstrength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.\n13 And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.\n14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and\nfrom thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the\nearth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.\n15 And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall\nbe taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any\nfinding him should smite him.\n16 And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod,\non the east of Eden.\n17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a\ncity, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.\n18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael; and Mehujael begat\nMethushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.\n19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the\nname of the other Zillah.\n20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and [have]\ncattle.\n21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the\nharp and pipe.\n22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument\nof brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.\n23 And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of\nLamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a\nyoung man for bruising me:\n24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.\n25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth:\nFor, [said she], God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain\nslew him.\n26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh.\nThen began men to call upon the name of Jehovah.\n\nChapter 5\n\n1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man,\nin the likeness of God made he him;\n2 male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam,\nin the day when they were created.\n3 And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat [a son] in his own\nlikeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:\n4 and the days of Adam after he begat Seth were eight hundred years: and he\nbegat sons and daughters.\n5 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he\ndied.\n6 And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enosh:\n7 and Seth lived after he begat Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and begat\nsons and daughters:\n8 and all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.\n9 And Enosh lived ninety years, and begat Kenan:\n10 and Enosh lived after he begat Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and\nbegat sons and daughters:\n11 and all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years: and he died.\n12 And Kenan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalalel:\n13 and Kenan lived after he begat Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and\nbegat sons and daughters:\n14 and all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.\n15 And Mahalalel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:\n16 And Mahalalel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and\nbegat sons and daughters:\n17 and all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and\nhe died.\n18 And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and begat Enoch:\n19 and Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and\ndaughters:\n20 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.\n21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:\n22 and Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and\nbegat sons and daughters:\n23 and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:\n24 and Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.\n25 And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:\n26 and Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two\nyears, and begat sons and daughters:\n27 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he\ndied.\n28 And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:\n29 and he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us in our work\nand in the toil of our hands, [which cometh] because of the ground which Jehovah\nhath cursed.\n30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and\nbegat sons and daughters:\n31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he\ndied.\n32 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n\nChapter 6\n\n1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and\ndaughters were born unto them,\n2 that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they\ntook them wives of all that they chose.\n3 And Jehovah said, My Spirit shall not strive with man for ever, for that he\nalso is flesh: yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years. [\n4 The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the\nsons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them:\nthe same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.\n5 And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that\nevery imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\n6 And it repented Jehovah that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him\nat his heart.\n7 And Jehovah said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the\nground; both man, and beast, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; for\nit repenteth me that I have made them.\n8 But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.\n9 These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, [and] perfect in\nhis generations: Noah walked with God.\n10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n11 And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.\n12 And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had\ncorrupted their way upon the earth.\n13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth\nis filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the\nearth.\n14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt\npitch it within and without with pitch.\n15 And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred\ncubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.\n16 A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it\nupward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower,\nsecond, and third stories shalt thou make it.\n17 And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all\nflesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is in\nthe earth shall die.\n18 But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark,\nthou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.\n19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring\ninto the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.\n20 Of the birds after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every\ncreeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto\nthee, to keep them alive.\n21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and\nit shall be for food for thee, and for them.\n22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.\n\nChapter 7\n\n1 And Jehovah said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee\nhave I seen righteous before me in this generation.\n2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his\nfemale; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female:\n3 of the birds also of the heavens, seven and seven, male and female, to keep\nseed alive upon the face of all the earth.\n4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and\nforty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I destroy from off\nthe face of the ground.\n5 And Noah did according unto all that Jehovah commanded him.\n6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the\nearth.\n7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him,\ninto the ark, because of the waters of the flood.\n8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of\neverything that creepeth upon the ground,\n9 there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God\ncommanded Noah.\n10 And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were\nupon the earth.\n11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the\nseventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the\ngreat deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.\n12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.\n13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of\nNoah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;\n14 they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind,\nand every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every\nbird after its kind, every bird of every sort.\n15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is\nthe breath of life.\n16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded\nhim: and Jehovah shut him in.\n17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and\nbare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.\n18 And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark\nwent upon the face of the waters.\n19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high\nmountains that were under the whole heaven were covered.\n20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.\n21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both birds, and cattle, and\nbeasts, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:\n22 all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was\non the dry land, died.\n23 And every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of the ground,\nboth man, and cattle, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; and they\nwere destroyed from the earth: and Noah only was left, and they that were with\nhim in the ark.\n24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.\n\nChapter 8\n\n1 And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with\nhim in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters\nassuaged;\n2 the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the\nrain from heaven was restrained;\n3 and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of a\nhundred and fifty days the waters decreased.\n4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month,\nupon the mountains of Ararat.\n5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth\nmonth, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.\n6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of\nthe ark which he had made:\n7 and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were\ndried up from off the earth.\n8 And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off\nthe face of the ground;\n9 but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him\nto the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth\nhis hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark.\n10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of\nthe ark;\n11 and the dove came in to him at eventide; and, lo, in her mouth an olive-leaf\nplucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.\n12 And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she returned\nnot again unto him any more.\n13 And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month,\nthe first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and\nNoah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the\nground was dried.\n14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the\nearth dry.\n15 And God spake unto Noah, saying,\n16 Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives\nwith thee.\n17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both\nbirds, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that\nthey may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the\nearth.\n18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with\nhim:\n19 every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatsoever moveth upon the\nearth, after their families, went forth out of the ark.\n20 And Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah, and took of every clean beast, and of\nevery clean bird, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.\n21 And Jehovah smelled the sweet savor; and Jehovah said in his heart, I will\nnot again curse the ground any more for man's sake, for that the imagination of\nman's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more\neverything living, as I have done.\n22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and\nsummer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.\n\nChapter 9\n\n1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and\nmultiply, and replenish the earth.\n2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the\nearth, and upon every bird of the heavens; with all wherewith the ground\nteemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered.\n3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the green herb have I\ngiven you all.\n4 But flesh with the life thereof, [which is] the blood thereof, shall ye not\neat.\n5 And surely your blood, [the blood] of your lives, will I require; at the hand\nof every beast will I require it: and at the hand of man, even at the hand of\nevery man's brother, will I require the life of man.\n6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: For in the image\nof God made he man.\n7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth,\nand multiply therein.\n8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,\n9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;\n10 and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and\nevery beast of the earth with you; of all that go out of the ark, even every\nbeast of the earth.\n11 And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off\nany more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to\ndestroy the earth.\n12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and\nyou and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:\n13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant\nbetween me and the earth.\n14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow\nshall be seen in the cloud,\n15 and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living\ncreature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy\nall flesh.\n16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may\nremember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all\nflesh that is upon the earth.\n17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have\nestablished between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.\n18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and\nJapheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.\n19 These three were the sons of Noah: and of these was the whole earth\noverspread.\n20 And Noah began to be a husbandman, and planted a vineyard:\n21 and he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his\ntent.\n22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his\ntwo brethren without.\n23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders,\nand went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces\nwere backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.\n24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto\nhim.\n25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants shall he be unto his\nbrethren.\n26 And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem; And let Canaan be his\nservant.\n27 God enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan\nbe his servant.\n28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.\n29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: And he died.\n\nChapter 10\n\n1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, [namely], of Shem, Ham, and\nJapheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.\n2 The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and\nMeshech, and Tiras.\n3 And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.\n4 And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.\n5 Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after\nhis tongue, after their families, in their nations.\n6 And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.\n7 And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca;\nand the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan.\n8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.\n9 He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah: wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a\nmighty hunter before Jehovah.\n10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh,\nin the land of Shinar.\n11 Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and\nRehoboth-Ir, and Calah,\n12 and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).\n13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,\n14 and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (whence went forth the Philistines), and\nCaphtorim.\n15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,\n16 and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,\n17 and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,\n18 and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the\nfamilies of the Canaanite spread abroad.\n19 And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as thou goest toward Gerar,\nunto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto\nLasha.\n20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in\ntheir lands, in their nations.\n21 And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of\nJapheth, to him also were children born.\n22 The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram.\n23 And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.\n24 And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Eber.\n25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg; for in his\ndays was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.\n26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,\n27 and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,\n28 and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,\n29 and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.\n30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain\nof the east.\n31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in\ntheir lands, after their nations.\n32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their\nnations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.\n\nChapter 11\n\n1 And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.\n2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the\nland of Shinar; and they dwelt there.\n3 And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them\nthoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.\n4 And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top [may\nreach] unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon\nthe face of the whole earth.\n5 And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men\nbuilded.\n6 And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language;\nand this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them,\nwhich they purpose to do.\n7 Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not\nunderstand one another's speech.\n8 So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth:\nand they left off building the city.\n9 Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because Jehovah did there confound\nthe language of all the earth: and from thence did Jehovah scatter them abroad\nupon the face of all the earth.\n10 These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begat\nArpachshad two years after the flood:\n11 and Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad five hundred years, and begat sons\nand daughters.\n12 And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah:\n13 and Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three years, and\nbegat sons and daughters.\n14 And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:\n15 and Shelah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat\nsons and daughters.\n16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:\n17 and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat\nsons and daughters.\n18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:\n19 and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons\nand daughters.\n20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:\n21 and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat\nsons and daughters.\n22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:\n23 and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and\ndaughters.\n24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:\n25 and Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat\nsons and daughters.\n26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.\n27 Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran;\nand Haran begat Lot.\n28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of\nthe Chaldees.\n29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and\nthe name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah,\nand the father of Iscah.\n30 And Sarai was barren; she had no child.\n31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and\nSarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them\nfrom Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto\nHaran, and dwelt there.\n32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in\nHaran.\n\nChapter 12\n\n1 Now Jehovah said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy\nkindred, and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show thee:\n2 and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make they\nname great; and be thou a blessing:\n3 and I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse:\nand in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.\n4 So Abram went, as Jehovah had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and\nAbram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.\n5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their\nsubstance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran;\nand they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan\nthey came.\n6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the oak of\nMoreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.\n7 And Jehovah appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this\nland: and there builded he an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared unto him.\n8 And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and\npitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he\nbuilded an altar unto Jehovah, and called upon the name of Jehovah.\n9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.\n10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn\nthere; for the famine was sore in the land.\n11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said\nunto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:\n12 and it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will\nsay, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.\n13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy\nsake, and that my soul may live because of thee.\n14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians\nbeheld the woman that she was very fair.\n15 And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman\nwas taken into Pharaoh's house.\n16 And he dealt well with Abram for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and\nhe-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.\n17 And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of\nSarai, Abram's wife.\n18 And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me?\nwhy didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?\n19 why saidst thou, She is my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? now\ntherefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.\n20 And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way,\nand his wife, and all that he had.\n\nChapter 13\n\n1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot\nwith him, into the South.\n2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.\n3 And he went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el, unto the place\nwhere his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Ai,\n4 unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there\nAbram called on the name of Jehovah.\n5 And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.\n6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for\ntheir substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.\n7 And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen\nof Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.\n8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and\nthee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen; for we are brethren.\n9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if\n[thou wilt take] the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if [thou take]\nthe right hand, then I will go to the left.\n10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the Plain of the Jordan, that it\nwas well watered every where, before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like\nthe garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest unto Zoar.\n11 So Lot chose him all the Plain of the Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and\nthey separated themselves the one from the other.\n12 Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain,\nand moved his tent as far as Sodom.\n13 Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against Jehovah exceedingly.\n14 And Jehovah said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up\nnow thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward\nand eastward and westward:\n15 for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed\nfor ever.\n16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can\nnumber the dust of the earth, then may thy seed also be numbered.\n17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it;\nfor unto thee will I give it.\n18 And Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are\nin Hebron, and built there an altar unto Jehovah.\n\nChapter 14\n\n1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of\nEllasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,\n2 that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah,\nShinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the\nsame is Zoar).\n3 All these joined together in the vale of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea).\n4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they\nrebelled.\n5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with\nhim, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the\nEmim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,\n6 and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.\n7 And they returned, and came to En-mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and smote all\nthe country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in\nHazazon-tamar.\n8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king\nof Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar); and\nthey set the battle in array against them in the vale of Siddim;\n9 against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king\nof Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.\n10 Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and\nGomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain.\n11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals,\nand went their way.\n12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods,\nand departed.\n13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew: now he dwelt\nby the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and\nthese were confederate with Abram. [\n14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his\ntrained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far\nas Dan.\n15 And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote\nthem, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.\n16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot, and\nhis goods, and the women also, and the people.\n17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the\nslaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the vale of\nShaveh (the same is the King's Vale).\n18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was priest\nof God Most High.\n19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of\nheaven and earth:\n20 and blessed be God Most High, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.\nAnd he gave him a tenth of all.\n21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the\ngoods to thyself.\n22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah,\nGod Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,\n23 that I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine,\nlest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:\n24 save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men\nthat went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.\n\nChapter 15\n\n1 After these things the word of Jehovah came unto Abram in a vision, saying,\nFear not, Abram: I am thy shield, [and] thy exceeding great reward.\n2 And Abram said, O Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless,\nand he that shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?\n3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my\nhouse is mine heir.\n4 And, behold, the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying, This man shall not be\nthine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine\nheir.\n5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and number\nthe stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy\nseed be.\n6 And he believed in Jehovah; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.\n7 And he said unto him, I am Jehovah that brought thee out of Ur of the\nChaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.\n8 And he said, O Lord Jehovah, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?\n9 And he said unto him, Take me a heifer three years old, and a she-goat three\nyears old, and a ram three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.\n10 And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half\nover against the other: but the birds divided he not.\n11 And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them\naway.\n12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a\nhorror of great darkness fell upon him.\n13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be sojourners in\na land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them\nfour hundred years;\n14 and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward\nshall they come out with great substance.\n15 But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old\nage.\n16 And in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity\nof the Amorite is not yet full.\n17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a\nsmoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces.\n18 In that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I\ngiven this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river\nEuphrates:\n19 the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,\n20 and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,\n21 and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.\n\nChapter 16\n\n1 Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children: and she had a handmaid, an\nEgyptian, whose name was Hagar.\n2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, Jehovah hath restrained me from\nbearing; go in, I pray thee, unto my handmaid; it may be that I shall obtain\nchildren by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.\n3 And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram\nhad dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to\nbe his wife.\n4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had\nconceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.\n5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I gave my handmaid into thy\nbosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes:\nJehovah judge between me and thee.\n6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her that\nwhich is good in thine eyes. And Sarai dealt hardly with her, and she fled from\nher face.\n7 And the angel of Jehovah found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness,\nby the fountain in the way to Shur.\n8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, whence camest thou? and whither goest\nthou? And she said, I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.\n9 And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit\nthyself under her hands.\n10 And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, I will greatly multiply thy seed,\nthat it shall not be numbered for multitude.\n11 And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and\nshalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name Ishmael, because Jehovah hath\nheard thy affliction.\n12 And he shall be [as] a wild ass among men; his hand [shall be] against every\nman, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell over against all his\nbrethren.\n13 And she called the name of Jehovah that spake unto her, Thou art a God that\nseeth: for she said, Have I even here looked after him that seeth me?\n14 Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh\nand Bered.\n15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar\nbare, Ishmael.\n16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.\n\nChapter 17\n\n1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, Jehovah appeared to Abram, and\nsaid unto him, I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be thou perfect.\n2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee\nexceedingly.\n3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,\n4 As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be the father of a\nmultitude of nations.\n5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be\nAbraham; for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee.\n6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and\nkings shall come out of thee.\n7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee\nthroughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee\nand to thy seed after thee.\n8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy\nsojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will\nbe their God.\n9 And God said unto Abraham, And as for thee, thou shalt keep my covenant, thou,\nand thy seed after thee throughout their generations.\n10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed\nafter thee: every male among you shall be circumcised.\n11 And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a\ntoken of a covenant betwixt me and you.\n12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male\nthroughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money\nof any foreigner that is not of thy seed.\n13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must\nneeds be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting\ncovenant.\n14 And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his\nforeskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my\ncovenant.\n15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her\nname Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.\n16 And I will bless her, and moreover I will give thee a son of her: yea, I will\nbless her, and she shall be [a mother of] nations; kings of peoples shall be of\nher.\n17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a\nchild be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is\nninety years old, bear?\n18 And Abraham said unto God, Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!\n19 And God said, Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt\ncall his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an\neverlasting covenant for his seed after him. [\n20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: behold, I have blessed him, and will\nmake him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he\nbeget, and I will make him a great nation.\n21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee\nat this set time in the next year.\n22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.\n23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and\nall that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's\nhouse, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God\nhad said unto him.\n24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the\nflesh of his foreskin.\n25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the\nflesh of his foreskin.\n26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.\n27 And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with\nmoney of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.\n\nChapter 18\n\n1 And Jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door\nin the heat of the day;\n2 and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against\nhim: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed\nhimself to the earth,\n3 and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I\npray thee, from thy servant:\n4 let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves\nunder the tree:\n5 and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart; after that\nye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So\ndo, as thou hast said.\n6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly\nthree measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.\n7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it\nunto the servant; and he hasted to dress it.\n8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it\nbefore them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.\n9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the\ntent.\n10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round;\nand, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door,\nwhich was behind him.\n11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old, [and] well stricken in age; it had ceased to\nbe with Sarah after the manner of women.\n12 And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have\npleasure, my lord being old also?\n13 And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of\na surety bear a child, who am old?\n14 Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return unto thee,\nwhen the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son.\n15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said,\nNay; but thou didst laugh.\n16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went\nwith them to bring them on the way.\n17 And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;\n18 seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all\nthe nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?\n19 For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his\nhousehold after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness\nand justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he hath\nspoken of him.\n20 And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because\ntheir sin is very grievous;\n21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to\nthe cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.\n22 And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet\nbefore Jehovah.\n23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the\nwicked?\n24 Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and\nnot spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?\n25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the\nwicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee:\nshall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\n26 And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I\nwill spare all the place for their sake.\n27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto\nthe Lord, who am but dust and ashes:\n28 peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy\nall the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find\nthere forty and five.\n29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty\nfound there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty's sake.\n30 And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure\nthere shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find\nthirty there.\n31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord:\nperadventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy\nit for the twenty's sake.\n32 And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this\nonce: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it\nfor the ten's sake.\n33 And Jehovah went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham:\nand Abraham returned unto his place.\n\nChapter 19\n\n1 And the two angels came to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom:\nand Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face\nto the earth;\n2 and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into your servant's\nhouse, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and\ngo on your way. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.\n3 And he urged them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his\nhouse; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did\neat.\n4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, [even] the men of Sodom,\ncompassed the house round, both young and old, all the people from every\nquarter;\n5 and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men that came in to\nthee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.\n6 And Lot went out unto them to the door, and shut the door after him.\n7 And he said, I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly.\n8 Behold now, I have two daughters that have not known man; let me, I pray you,\nbring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto\nthese men do nothing, forasmuch as they are come under the shadow of my roof.\n9 And they said, Stand back. And they said, This one fellow came in to sojourn,\nand he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them.\nAnd they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and drew near to break the door.\n10 But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and\nshut to the door.\n11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness,\nboth small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.\n12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy\nsons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of\nthe place:\n13 for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxed great before\nJehovah; and Jehovah hath sent us to destroy it.\n14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons-in-law, who married his daughters,\nand said, Up, get you out of this place; for Jehovah will destroy the city. But\nhe seemed unto his sons-in-law as one that mocked.\n15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take\nthy wife, and thy two daughters that are here, lest thou be consumed in the\niniquity of the city.\n16 But he lingered; and the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of\nhis wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful unto\nhim: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.\n17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said,\nEscape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the Plain;\nescape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.\n18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my lord:\n19 behold now, thy servant hath found favor in thy sight, and thou hast\nmagnified thy lovingkindness, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life;\nand I cannot escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die:\n20 behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one. Oh let me\nescape thither (is it not a little one?), and my soul shall live.\n21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also,\nthat I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken.\n22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come\nthither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.\n23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came unto Zoar.\n24 Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from\nJehovah out of heaven;\n25 and he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of\nthe cities, and that which grew upon the ground.\n26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.\n27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he had stood\nbefore Jehovah:\n28 and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the\nPlain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a\nfurnace.\n29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God\nremembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he\noverthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.\n30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters\nwith him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two\ndaughters.\n31 And the first-born said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not\na man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:\n32 come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we\nmay preserve seed of our father.\n33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the first-born went in,\nand lay with her father; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.\n34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the first-born said unto the younger,\nBehold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night\nalso; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose,\nand lay with him; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.\n36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.\n37 And the first-born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the\nfather of the Moabites unto this day.\n38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same\nis the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.\n\nChapter 20\n\n1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt\nbetween Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar.\n2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of\nGerar sent, and took Sarah.\n3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, Behold,\nthou art but a dead man, because of the woman whom thou hast taken; for she is a\nman's wife.\n4 Now Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay even a\nrighteous nation?\n5 Said he not himself unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said,\nHe is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands\nhave I done this.\n6 And God said unto him in the dream, Yea, I know that in the integrity of thy\nheart thou has done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against me:\ntherefore suffered I thee not to touch her.\n7 Now therefore restore the man's wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray\nfor thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou\nshalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.\n8 And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told\nall these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.\n9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us?\nand wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my\nkingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.\n10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this\nthing?\n11 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this\nplace; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.\n12 And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the\ndaughter of my mother; and she became my wife:\n13 and it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house,\nthat I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me: at\nevery place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.\n14 And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants, and\ngave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.\n15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth\nthee.\n16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of\nsilver: behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee;\nand in respect of all thou art righted.\n17 And Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his\nmaid-servants; and they bare children.\n18 For Jehovah had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech,\nbecause of Sarah, Abraham's wife.\n\nChapter 21\n\n1 And Jehovah visited Sarah as he had said, and Jehovah did unto Sarah as he had\nspoken.\n2 And Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of\nwhich God had spoken to him.\n3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare\nto him, Isaac.\n4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had\ncommanded him.\n5 And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.\n6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh; every one that heareth will laugh\nwith me.\n7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give\nchildren suck? for I have borne him a son in his old age.\n8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast on the day\nthat Isaac was weaned.\n9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham,\nmocking.\n10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son: for the\nson of this handmaid shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.\n11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son.\n12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the\nlad, and because of thy handmaid; in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken\nunto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.\n13 And also of the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy\nseed.\n14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of\nwater, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and [gave her] the\nchild, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of\nBeer-sheba.\n15 And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of\nthe shrubs.\n16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a\nbowshot: for she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child. And she sat\nover against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.\n17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out\nof heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath\nheard the voice of the lad where he is.\n18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand; for I will make him a great\nnation.\n19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and\nfilled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.\n20 And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and\nbecame, as he grew up, an archer.\n21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out\nof the land of Egypt.\n22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of\nhis host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:\n23 now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with\nme, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I\nhave done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast\nsojourned.\n24 And Abraham said, I will swear.\n25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which\nAbimelech's servants had violently taken away.\n26 And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou\ntell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to-day.\n27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and they two\nmade a covenant.\n28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.\n29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou\nhast set by themselves?\n30 And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be\na witness unto me, that I have digged this well.\n31 Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of\nthem.\n32 So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the\ncaptain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.\n33 And [Abraham] planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the\nname of Jehovah, the Everlasting God.\n34 And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.\n\nChapter 22\n\n1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said\nunto him, Abraham; and he said, Here am I.\n2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac,\nand get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering\nupon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.\n3 And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of\nhis young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he clave the wood for the\nburnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.\n4 On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.\n5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the\nlad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come again to you.\n6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his\nson; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them\ntogether.\n7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said,\nHere am I, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood: but where is the\nlamb for a burnt-offering?\n8 And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my\nson: so they went both of them together.\n9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built the\naltar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him\non the altar, upon the wood.\n10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.\n11 And the angel of Jehovah called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham,\nAbraham: and he said, Here I am.\n12 And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto\nhim; for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy\nson, thine only son, from me.\n13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, behind [him] a ram\ncaught in the thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and\noffered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.\n14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to\nthis day, In the mount of Jehovah it shall be provided.\n15 And the angel of Jehovah called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven,\n16 and said, By myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah, because thou hast done this\nthing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son,\n17 that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy\nseed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore;\nand thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;\n18 and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou\nhast obeyed my voice.\n19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to\nBeer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.\n20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying,\nBehold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto thy brother Nahor:\n21 Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,\n22 and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.\n23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham's\nbrother.\n24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bare Tebah, and Gaham, and\nTahash, and Maacah.\n\nChapter 23\n\n1 And the life of Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years: these were the\nyears of the life of Sarah.\n2 And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan:\nand Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.\n3 And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spake unto the children of Heth,\nsaying,\n4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a\nburying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.\n5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,\n6 Hear us, my lord; thou art a prince of God among us: in the choice of our\nsepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but\nthat thou mayest bury thy dead.\n7 And Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the\nchildren of Heth.\n8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my\ndead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,\n9 that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end\nof his field; for the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you for a\npossession of a burying-place.\n10 Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Heth: and Ephron the\nHittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all\nthat went in at the gate of his city, saying,\n11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I\ngive it thee; in the presence of the children of my people give I it thee: bury\nthy dead.\n12 And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.\n13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying,\nBut if thou wilt, I pray thee, hear me: I will give the price of the field; take\nit of me, and I will bury my dead there.\n14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,\n15 My lord, hearken unto me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of\nsilver, what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.\n16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver\nwhich he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels\nof silver, current [money] with the merchant.\n17 So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the\nfield, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field,\nthat were in all the border thereof round about, were made sure\n18 unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before\nall that went in at the gate of his city.\n19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of\nMachpelah before Mamre (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan.\n20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for\na possession of a burying-place by the children of Heth.\n\nChapter 24\n\n1 And Abraham was old, [and] well stricken in age: and Jehovah had blessed\nAbraham in all things.\n2 And Abraham said unto his servant, the elder of his house, that ruled over all\nthat he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:\n3 and I will make thee swear by Jehovah, the God of heaven and the God of the\nearth, that thou wilt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the\nCanaanites, among whom I dwell:\n4 but thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my\nson Isaac.\n5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to\nfollow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from\nwhence thou camest?\n6 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither\nagain.\n7 Jehovah, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the\nland of my nativity, and who spake unto me, and who sware unto me, saying, Unto\nthy seed will I give this land; he will send his angel before thee, and thou\nshalt take a wife for my son from thence.\n8 And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from\nthis my oath; only thou shalt not bring my son thither again.\n9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware\nto him concerning this matter.\n10 And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed,\nhaving all goodly things of his master's in his hand: and he arose, and went to\nMesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.\n11 And he made the camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at\nthe time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.\n12 And he said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray thee,\ngood speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham.\n13 Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water; and the daughters of the men\nof the city are coming out to draw water:\n14 and let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy\npitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will\ngive thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy\nservant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my\nmaster.\n15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came\nout, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's\nbrother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.\n16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man\nknown her: and she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came\nup.\n17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a\nlittle water from thy pitcher.\n18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon\nher hand, and gave him drink.\n19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy camels\nalso, until they have done drinking.\n20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto\nthe well to draw, and drew for all his camels.\n21 And the man looked stedfastly on her, holding his peace, to know whether\nJehovah had made his journey prosperous or not.\n22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a\ngolden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten\nshekels weight of gold,\n23 and said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy\nfather's house for us to lodge in?\n24 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom\nshe bare unto Nahor.\n25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room\nto lodge in.\n26 And the man bowed his head, and worshipped Jehovah.\n27 And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who hath not\nforsaken his lovingkindness and his truth toward my master: as for me, Jehovah\nhath led me in the way to the house of my master's brethren.\n28 And the damsel ran, and told her mother's house according to these words.\n29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the\nman, unto the fountain.\n30 And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his\nsister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus\nspake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he was standing\nby the camels at the fountain.\n31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of Jehovah; wherefore standest thou\nwithout? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.\n32 And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels; and he gave\nstraw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of\nthe men that were with him.\n33 And there was set food before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until\nI have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.\n34 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.\n35 And Jehovah hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he\nhath given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and men-servants and\nmaid-servants, and camels and asses.\n36 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto\nhim hath he given all that he hath.\n37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of\nthe daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:\n38 but thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife\nfor my son.\n39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.\n40 And he said unto me, Jehovah, before whom I walk, will send his angel with\nthee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred,\nand of my father's house:\n41 then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if\nthey give her not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath.\n42 And I came this day unto the fountain, and said, O Jehovah, the God of my\nmaster Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:\n43 behold, I am standing by the fountain of water; and let it come to pass, that\nthe maiden that cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee,\na little water from thy pitcher to drink;\n44 and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy\ncamels: let the same be the woman whom Jehovah hath appointed for my master's\nson.\n45 And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with\nher pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the fountain, and drew: and\nI said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.\n46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said,\nDrink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the\ncamels drink also.\n47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The\ndaughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the ring\nupon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands.\n48 And I bowed my head, and worshipped Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah, the God of\nmy master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's\ndaughter for his son.\n49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not,\ntell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.\n50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from Jehovah:\nwe cannot speak unto thee bad or good.\n51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's\nson's wife, as Jehovah hath spoken.\n52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed\nhimself down to the earth unto Jehovah.\n53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and\nraiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother\nprecious things.\n54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried\nall night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my\nmaster.\n55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us [a few]\ndays, at the least ten; after that she shall go.\n56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing Jehovah hath prospered my way;\nsend me away that I may go to my master.\n57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.\n58 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And\nshe said, I will go.\n59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's\nservant, and his men.\n60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Our sister, be thou [the mother]\nof thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those that\nhate them.\n61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and\nfollowed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.\n62 And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the land of\nthe South.\n63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up\nhis eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.\n64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the\ncamel.\n65 And she said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to\nmeet us? And the servant said, It is my master: and she took her veil, and\ncovered herself.\n66 And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.\n67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she\nbecame his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's\ndeath.\n\nChapter 25\n\n1 And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.\n2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and\nShuah.\n3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and\nLetushim, and Leummim.\n4 And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah.\nAll these were the children of Keturah.\n5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.\n6 But unto the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and\nhe sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the\neast country.\n7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a\nhundred threescore and fifteen years.\n8 And Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and\nfull [of years], and was gathered to his people.\n9 And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the\nfield of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;\n10 the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth: there was Abraham\nburied, and Sarah his wife.\n11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his\nson: and Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi.\n12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the\nEgyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:\n13 and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to\ntheir generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel,\nand Mibsam,\n14 and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,\n15 Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:\n16 these are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages,\nand by their encampments; twelve princes according to their nations.\n17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and\nseven years: and he gave up the ghost and died, and was gathered unto his\npeople.\n18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest\ntoward Assyria: he abode over against all his brethren.\n19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:\n20 and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel\nthe Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.\n21 And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren: and Jehovah\nwas entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.\n22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so,\nwherefore do I live? And she went to inquire of Jehovah.\n23 And Jehovah said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, And two peoples shall\nbe separated from thy bowels: And the one people shall be stronger than the\nother people; And the elder shall serve the younger.\n24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in\nher womb.\n25 And the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called\nhis name Esau.\n26 And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel;\nand his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare\nthem.\n27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field; and\nJacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.\n28 Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: and Rebekah loved\nJacob.\n29 And Jacob boiled pottage: and Esau came in from the field, and he was faint:\n30 and Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red [pottage] ;\nfor I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.\n31 And Jacob said, Sell me first thy birthright.\n32 And Esau said, Behold, I am about to die: and what profit shall the\nbirthright do to me?\n33 And Jacob said, Swear to me first; and he sware unto him: and he sold his\nbirthright unto Jacob.\n34 And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink,\nand rose up, and went his way: so Esau despised his birthright.\n\nChapter 26\n\n1 And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the\ndays of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto\nGerar.\n2 And Jehovah appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the\nland which I shall tell thee of:\n3 sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto\nthee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the\noath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;\n4 and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy\nseed all these lands; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be\nblessed;\n5 because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my\nstatutes, and my laws.\n6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:\n7 and the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister:\nfor he feared to say, My wife; lest, [said he], the men of the place should kill\nme for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.\n8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king\nof the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was\nsporting with Rebekah his wife.\n9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and\nhow saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest\nI die because of her.\n10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? One of the people\nmight easily have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness\nupon us.\n11 And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that toucheth this man or\nhis wife shall surely be put to death.\n12 And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold: and\nJehovah blessed him.\n13 And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great:\n14 and he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great\nhousehold: and the Philistines envied him.\n15 Now all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of\nAbraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.\n16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than\nwe.\n17 And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt\nthere.\n18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days\nof Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of\nAbraham; and he called their names after the names by which his father had\ncalled them.\n19 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of\nspringing water.\n20 And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is\nours: and he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.\n21 And they digged another well, and they strove for that also: and he called\nthe name of it Sitnah.\n22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove\nnot: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now Jehovah hath\nmade room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.\n23 And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.\n24 And Jehovah appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of\nAbraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and\nmultiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.\n25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of Jehovah, and\npitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.\n26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol\nthe captain of his host.\n27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me,\nand have sent me away from you?\n28 And they said, We saw plainly that Jehovah was with thee: and we said, Let\nthere now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a\ncovenant with thee,\n29 that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have\ndone unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now\nthe blessed of Jehovah.\n30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.\n31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac\nsent them away, and they departed from him in peace.\n32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him\nconcerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found\nwater.\n33 And he called it Shibah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto\nthis day.\n34 And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of\nBeeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:\n35 and they were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.\n\nChapter 27\n\n1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that\nhe could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said unto him, My son: and\nhe said unto him, Here am I.\n2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.\n3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go\nout to the field, and take me venison;\n4 and make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat;\nthat my soul may bless thee before I die.\n5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field\nto hunt for venison, and to bring it.\n6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak\nunto Esau thy brother, saying,\n7 Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless thee\nbefore Jehovah before my death.\n8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.\n9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and\nI will make them savory food for thy father, such as he loveth:\n10 and thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless\nthee before his death.\n11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man,\nand I am a smooth man.\n12 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver;\nand I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.\n13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son; only obey my\nvoice, and go fetch me them.\n14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made\nsavory food, such as his father loved.\n15 And Rebekah took the goodly garments of Esau her elder son, which were with\nher in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son;\n16 and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the\nsmooth of his neck:\n17 and she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the\nhand of her son Jacob.\n18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who\nart thou, my son?\n19 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I have done\naccording as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that\nthy soul may bless me.\n20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my\nson? And he said, Because Jehovah thy God sent me good speed.\n21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my\nson, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.\n22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The\nvoice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.\n23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's\nhands: so he blessed him.\n24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.\n25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my\nsoul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he\nbrought him wine, and he drank.\n26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.\n27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment,\nand blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son Is as the smell of a field\nwhich Jehovah hath blessed:\n28 And God give thee of the dew of heaven, And of the fatness of the earth, And\nplenty of grain and new wine:\n29 Let peoples serve thee, And nations bow down to thee: Be lord over thy\nbrethren, And let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: Cursed be every one that\ncurseth thee, And blessed be every one that blesseth thee.\n30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and\nJacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau\nhis brother came in from his hunting.\n31 And he also made savory food, and brought it unto his father; and he said\nunto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy\nsoul may bless me.\n32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son,\nthy first-born, Esau.\n33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who then is he that hath taken\nvenison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have\nblessed him? yea, [and] he shall be blessed.\n34 When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and\nbitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.\n35 And he said, Thy brother came with guile, and hath taken away thy blessing.\n36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these\ntwo times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my\nblessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?\n37 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and\nall his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with grain and new wine\nhave I sustained him: and what then shall I do for thee, my son?\n38 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? Bless\nme, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.\n39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, of the fatness of\nthe earth shall be thy dwelling, And of the dew of heaven from above;\n40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and thou shalt serve thy brother; And it\nshall come to pass, when thou shalt break loose, That thou shalt shake his yoke\nfrom off thy neck.\n41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed\nhim: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand;\nthen will I slay my brother Jacob.\n42 And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah; and she sent and\ncalled Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as\ntouching thee, doth comfort himself, [purposing] to kill thee.\n43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my\nbrother to Haran;\n44 and tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;\n45 until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou\nhast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be\nbereaved of you both in one day?\n46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of\nHeth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the\ndaughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?\n\nChapter 28\n\n1 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him,\nThou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.\n2 Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and\ntake thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.\n3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that\nthou mayest be a company of peoples;\n4 and give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee;\nthat thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto\nAbraham.\n5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Paddan-aram unto Laban, son of\nBethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.\n6 Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram, to\ntake him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge,\nsaying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;\n7 and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram:\n8 and Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;\n9 and Esau went unto Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath\nthe daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.\n10 And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.\n11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the\nsun was set; and he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his\nhead, and lay down in that place to sleep.\n12 And he dreamed; and behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it\nreached to heaven; and, behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on\nit.\n13 And, behold, Jehovah stood above it, and said, I am Jehovah, the God of\nAbraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee\nwill I give it, and to thy seed;\n14 and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad\nto the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee\nand in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.\n15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest, and\nwill bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have\ndone that which I have spoken to thee of.\n16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Jehovah is in this\nplace; and I knew it not.\n17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other\nthan the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\n18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put\nunder his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.\n19 And he called the name of that place Beth-el: but the name of the city was\nLuz at the first.\n20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in\nthis way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,\n21 so that I come again to my father's house in peace, and Jehovah will be my\nGod,\n22 then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house: and\nof all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.\n\nChapter 29\n\n1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the\neast.\n2 And he looked, and, behold, a well in the field, and, lo, three flocks of\nsheep lying there by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and the\nstone upon the well's mouth was great.\n3 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the\nwell's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's\nmouth in its place.\n4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, Of Haran\nare we.\n5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know\nhim.\n6 And he said unto them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well: and,\nbehold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.\n7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should\nbe gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.\n8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they\nroll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.\n9 While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for\nshe kept them.\n10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's\nbrother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and\nrolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his\nmother's brother.\n11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.\n12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was\nRebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.\n13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son,\nthat he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to\nhis house. And he told Laban all these things.\n14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode\nwith him the space of a month.\n15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou\ntherefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?\n16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of\nthe younger was Rachel.\n17 And Leah's eyes were tender; but Rachel was beautiful and well-favored.\n18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel\nthy younger daughter.\n19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give\nher to another man: abide with me.\n20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few\ndays, for the love he had to her.\n21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I\nmay go in unto her.\n22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.\n23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and\nbrought her to him; and he went in unto her.\n24 And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid.\n25 And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah: and he said to\nLaban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for\nRachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?\n26 And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before\nthe first-born.\n27 Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the\nservice which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.\n28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter\nto wife.\n29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid.\n30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and\nserved with him yet seven other years.\n31 And Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb: but Rachel was\nbarren.\n32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she\nsaid, Because Jehovah hath looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will\nlove me.\n33 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and said, Because Jehovah hath heard\nthat I am hated, he hath therefore given me this [son] also: and she called his\nname Simeon.\n34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my\nhusband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons: therefore was\nhis name called Levi.\n35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, This time will I\npraise Jehovah: therefore she called his name Judah; and she left off bearing.\n\nChapter 30\n\n1 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister;\nand she said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.\n2 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's\nstead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?\n3 And she said, Behold, my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; that she may bear upon\nmy knees, and I also may obtain children by her.\n4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.\n5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.\n6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath\ngiven me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.\n7 And Bilhah Rachel's handmaid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.\n8 And Rachel said, With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and\nhave prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.\n9 When Leah saw that she had left off bearing, she took Zilpah her handmaid, and\ngave her to Jacob to wife.\n10 And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bare Jacob a son.\n11 And Leah said, Fortunate! and she called his name Gad.\n12 And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bare Jacob a second son.\n13 And Leah said, Happy am I! for the daughters will call me happy: and she\ncalled his name Asher.\n14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the\nfield, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me,\nI pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes. [\n15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my\nhusband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said,\nTherefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son's mandrakes.\n16 And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him,\nand said, Thou must come in unto me; for I have surely hired thee with my son's\nmandrakes. And he lay with her that night.\n17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob a fifth son.\n18 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my\nhusband: and she called his name Issachar.\n19 And Leah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Jacob.\n20 And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband\ndwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name\nZebulun.\n21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.\n22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.\n23 And she conceived, and bare a son: and said, God hath taken away my reproach:\n24 and she called his name Joseph, saying, Jehovah add to me another son.\n25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto\nLaban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.\n26 Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go:\nfor thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee.\n27 And Laban said unto him, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, [tarry] :\n[for] I have divined that Jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake.\n28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.\n29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle\nhave fared with me.\n30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it hath increased unto\na multitude; and Jehovah hath blessed thee whithersoever I turned: and now when\nshall I provide for mine own house also?\n31 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me\naught: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep\nit.\n32 I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence every speckled\nand spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and\nspeckled among the goats: and [of such] shall be my hire.\n33 So shall my righteousness answer for me hereafter, when thou shalt come\nconcerning my hire that is before thee: every one that is not speckled and\nspotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that, [if found] with me,\nshall be counted stolen.\n34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.\n35 And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and\nall the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in\nit, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his\nsons;\n36 and he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the\nrest of Laban's flocks.\n37 And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the\nplane-tree; and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which\nwas in the rods.\n38 And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the\ngutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they\nconceived when they came to drink.\n39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth\nringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.\n40 And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the\nringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves\napart, and put them not unto Laban's flock.\n41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that\nJacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might\nconceive among the rods;\n42 but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were\nLaban's, and the stronger Jacob's.\n43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants\nand men-servants, and camels and asses.\n\nChapter 31\n\n1 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that\nwas our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this\nglory.\n2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him\nas beforetime.\n3 And Jehovah said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy\nkindred; and I will be with thee.\n4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,\n5 and said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me\nas beforetime; but the God of my father hath been with me.\n6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.\n7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God\nsuffered him not to hurt me.\n8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bare\nspeckled: and if he said thus, The ringstreaked shall be thy wages; then bare\nall the flock ringstreaked.\n9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.\n10 And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceive, that I lifted up\nmine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the\nflock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled.\n11 And the angel of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here am I.\n12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see: all the he-goats which leap\nupon the flock are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all\nthat Laban doeth unto thee.\n13 I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a\nvow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of\nthy nativity.\n14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or\ninheritance for us in our father's house?\n15 Are we not accounted by him as foreigners? for he hath sold us, and hath also\nquite devoured our money.\n16 For all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, that is ours\nand our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.\n17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;\n18 and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had\ngathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go\nto Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan.\n19 Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that\nwere her father's.\n20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not\nthat he fled.\n21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the River,\nand set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.\n22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.\n23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey;\nand he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.\n24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said unto him,\nTake heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n25 And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain:\nand Laban with his brethren encamped in the mountain of Gilead.\n26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away\nunawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?\n27 Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not\ntell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret\nand with harp;\n28 and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast thou done\nfoolishly.\n29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father\nspake unto me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to\nJacob either good or bad.\n30 And now, [though] thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst\nafter thy father's house, [yet] wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?\n31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Lest\nthou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force.\n32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live: before our brethren\ndiscern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that\nRachel had stolen them.\n33 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of\nthe two maid-servants; but he found them not. And he went out of Leah's tent,\nand entered into Rachel's tent.\n34 Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel's saddle, and\nsat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not.\n35 And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up\nbefore thee; for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not\nthe teraphim.\n36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to\nLaban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after\nme?\n37 Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy\nhousehold stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may\njudge betwixt us two.\n38 These twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not\ncast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten.\n39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it;\nof my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.\n40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and\nmy sleep fled from mine eyes.\n41 These twenty years have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for\nthy two daughters, and six years for thy flock: and thou hast changed my wages\nten times.\n42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had\nbeen with me, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. God hath seen mine\naffliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.\n43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and\nthe children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou\nseest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their\nchildren whom they have borne?\n44 And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness\nbetween me and thee.\n45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.\n46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and\nmade a heap: and they did eat there by the heap.\n47 And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.\n48 And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore\nwas the name of it called Galeed:\n49 and Mizpah, for he said, Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we are\nabsent one from another.\n50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives besides my\ndaughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.\n51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I\nhave set betwixt me and thee.\n52 This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over\nthis heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar\nunto me, for harm.\n53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge\nbetwixt us. And Jacob sware by the Fear of his father Isaac.\n54 And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat\nbread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.\n55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his\ndaughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.\n\nChapter 32\n\n1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\n2 And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God's host: and he called the name of\nthat place Mahanaim.\n3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of\nSeir, the field of Edom.\n4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith\nthy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now:\n5 and I have oxen, and asses, [and] flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants:\nand I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.\n6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and\nmoreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.\n7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people\nthat were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two\ncompanies;\n8 and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company\nwhich is left shall escape.\n9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O\nJehovah, who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I\nwill do thee good:\n10 I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the\ntruth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over\nthis Jordan; and now I am become two companies.\n11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau:\nfor I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.\n12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of\nthe sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.\n13 And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a\npresent for Esau his brother:\n14 two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,\n15 thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty\nshe-asses and ten foals.\n16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself,\nand said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove\nand drove.\n17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and\nasketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these\nbefore thee?\n18 then thou shalt say, [They are] thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent\nunto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us.\n19 And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the\ndroves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;\n20 and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he\nsaid, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I\nwill see his face; peradventure he will accept me.\n21 So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in\nthe company.\n22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and\nhis eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.\n23 And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he\nhad.\n24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the\nbreaking of the day.\n25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of\nhis thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with\nhim.\n26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let\nthee go, except thou bless me.\n27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.\n28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou\nhast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.\n29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said,\nWherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.\n30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, [said he], I have seen\nGod face to face, and my life is preserved.\n31 And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his\nthigh.\n32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon\nthe hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's\nthigh in the sinew of the hip.\n\nChapter 33\n\n1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and\nwith him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto\nRachel, and unto the two handmaids.\n2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her\nchildren after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.\n3 And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven\ntimes, until he came near to his brother.\n4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed\nhim: and they wept.\n5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who\nare these with thee? And he said, The children whom God hath graciously given\nthy servant.\n6 Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed\nthemselves.\n7 And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came\nJoseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.\n8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this company which I met? And he said,\nTo find favor in the sight of my lord.\n9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let that which thou hast be thine.\n10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found favor in thy sight,\nthen receive my present at my hand; forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one\nseeth the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.\n11 Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt\ngraciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.\n12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before\nthee.\n13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and that\nthe flocks and herds with me have their young: and if they overdrive them one\nday, all the flocks will die.\n14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on\ngently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to\nthe pace of the children, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.\n15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me.\nAnd he said, What needeth it? let me find favor in the sight of my lord.\n16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.\n17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for\nhis cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.\n18 And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of\nCanaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city.\n19 And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand\nof the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money.\n20 And he erected there an altar, and called it El-Elohe-Israel.\n\nChapter 34\n\n1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the\ndaughters of the land.\n2 And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; and\nhe took her, and lay with her, and humbled her.\n3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel,\nand spake kindly unto the damsel.\n4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.\n5 Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with\nhis cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they came.\n6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.\n7 And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it: and the men\nwere grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel\nin lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.\n8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for\nyour daughter: I pray you, give her unto him to wife.\n9 And make ye marriages with us; give your daughters unto us, and take our\ndaughters unto you.\n10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade\nye therein, and get you possessions therein.\n11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find favor in\nyour eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.\n12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall\nsay unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.\n13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and\nspake, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,\n14 and said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that\nis uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us.\n15 Only on this condition will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we are,\nthat every male of you be circumcised;\n16 then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to\nus, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.\n17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our\ndaughter, and we will be gone.\n18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.\n19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in\nJacob's daughter: and he was honored above all the house of his father.\n20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed\nwith the men of their city, saying,\n21 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and\ntrade therein; for, behold, the land is large enough for them; let us take their\ndaughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.\n22 Only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to\nbecome one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are\ncircumcised.\n23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours? only\nlet us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.\n24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the\ngate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate\nof his city.\n25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the\nsons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and\ncame upon the city unawares, and slew all the males.\n26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took\nDinah out of Shechem's house, and went forth.\n27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they\nhad defiled their sister.\n28 They took their flocks and their herds and their asses, and that which was in\nthe city, and that which was in the field;\n29 and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, took they\ncaptive and made a prey, even all that was in the house.\n30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me odious to\nthe inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and, I\nbeing few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite\nme; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.\n31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?\n\nChapter 35\n\n1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make\nthere an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face\nof Esau thy brother.\n2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away\nthe foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your\ngarments:\n3 and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto\nGod, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which\nI went.\n4 And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and\nthe rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was\nby Shechem.\n5 And they journeyed: and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round\nabout them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.\n6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Beth-el), he\nand all the people that were with him.\n7 And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there\nGod was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.\n8 And Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the\noak: and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth.\n9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed\nhim.\n10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any\nmore Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.\n11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation\nand a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy\nloins;\n12 and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and\nto thy seed after thee will I give the land.\n13 And God went up from him in the place where he spake with him.\n14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spake with him, a pillar of\nstone: and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon.\n15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el.\n16 And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some distance to come to\nEphrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.\n17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto\nher, Fear not; for now thou shalt have another son.\n18 And it came to pass, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she\ncalled his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.\n19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is\nBeth-lehem).\n20 And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave: the same is the Pillar of Rachel's\ngrave unto this day.\n21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.\n22 And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and\nlay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of\nJacob were twelve:\n23 the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and\nJudah, and Issachar, and Zebulun;\n24 the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;\n25 and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid: Dan and Naphtali;\n26 and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad and Asher: these are the sons of\nJacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram.\n27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is\nHebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.\n28 And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years.\n29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old\nand full of days: and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.\n\nChapter 36\n\n1 Now these are the generations of Esau (the same is Edom).\n2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the\nHittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,\n3 and Basemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth.\n4 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Basemath bare Reuel;\n5 and Oholibamah bare Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau,\nthat were born unto him in the land of Canaan.\n6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of\nhis house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his possessions, which he\nhad gathered in the land of Canaan; and went into a land away from his brother\nJacob.\n7 For their substance was too great for them to dwell together; and the land of\ntheir sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle.\n8 And Esau dwelt in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.\n9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount\nSeir:\n10 these are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau,\nReuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau.\n11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.\n12 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz\nAmalek: these are the sons of Adah, Esau's wife.\n13 And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah:\nthese were the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife.\n14 And these were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of\nZibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah.\n15 These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the first-born\nof Esau: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,\n16 chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek: these are the chiefs that came of\nEliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah.\n17 And these are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief\nShammah, chief Mizzah: these are the chiefs that came of Reuel in the land of\nEdom; these are the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife.\n18 And these are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau's wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam,\nchief Korah: these are the chiefs that came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah,\nEsau's wife.\n19 These are the sons of Esau, and these are their chiefs: the same is Edom.\n20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and\nShobal and Zibeon and Anah,\n21 and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan: these are the chiefs that came of the\nHorites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.\n22 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Heman; and Lotan's sister was Timna.\n23 And these are the children of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and\nOnam.\n24 And these are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah; this is Anah who found\nthe hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.\n25 And these are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of\nAnah.\n26 And these are the children of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and\nCheran.\n27 These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan.\n28 These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran.\n29 These are the chiefs that came of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal,\nchief Zibeon, chief Anah,\n30 chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan: these are the chiefs that came of the\nHorites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.\n31 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there\nreigned any king over the children of Israel.\n32 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was\nDinhabah.\n33 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.\n34 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead.\n35 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of\nMoab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.\n36 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.\n37 And Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the River reigned in his stead.\n38 And Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.\n39 And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and\nthe name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of\nMatred, the daughter of Me-zahab.\n40 And these are the names of the chiefs that came of Esau, according to their\nfamilies, after their places, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief\nJetheth,\n41 chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,\n42 chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,\n43 chief Magdiel, chief Iram: these are the chiefs of Edom, according to their\nhabitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau, the father of the\nEdomites.\n\nChapter 37\n\n1 And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of\nCanaan.\n2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was\nfeeding the flock with his brethren; and he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah,\nand with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought the evil\nreport of them unto their father.\n3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of\nhis old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.\n4 And his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren;\nand they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.\n5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren: and they hated him\nyet the more.\n6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:\n7 for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose,\nand also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves came round about, and made\nobeisance to my sheaf.\n8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou\nindeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams,\nand for his words.\n9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said,\nBehold, I have dreamed yet a dream: and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven\nstars made obeisance to me.\n10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked\nhim, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and\nthy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the\nearth?\n11 And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying in mind.\n12 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.\n13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Are not thy brethren feeding the flock in\nShechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.\n14 And he said to him, Go now, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and\nwell with the flock; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of\nHebron, and he came to Shechem.\n15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and\nthe man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?\n16 And he said, I am seeking my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they are\nfeeding [the flock] .\n17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to\nDothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.\n18 And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired\nagainst him to slay him.\n19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.\n20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits,\nand we will say, An evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will\nbecome of his dreams.\n21 And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us\nnot take his life.\n22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in\nthe wilderness, but lay no hand upon him: that he might deliver him out of their\nhand, to restore him to his father.\n23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they\nstripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;\n24 and they took him, and cast him into the pit: and the pit was empty, there\nwas no water in it.\n25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked,\nand, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels\nbearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.\n26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother\nand conceal his blood?\n27 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon\nhim; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened unto him.\n28 And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up\nJoseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of\nsilver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.\n29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and\nhe rent his clothes.\n30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither\nshall I go?\n31 And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the\nblood;\n32 and they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father,\nand said, This have we found: know now whether it is thy son's coat or not.\n33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured\nhim; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.\n34 And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned\nfor his son many days.\n35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused\nto be comforted; and he said, For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning.\nAnd his father wept for him.\n36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of\nPharaoh's, the captain of the guard.\n\nChapter 38\n\n1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and\nturned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.\n2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; and\nhe took her, and went in unto her.\n3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.\n4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.\n5 And she yet again bare a son, and called his name Shelah: and he was at\nChezib, when she bare him.\n6 And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, and her name was Tamar.\n7 And Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah\nslew him.\n8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and perform the duty\nof a husband's brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother.\n9 And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass, when he\nwent in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he\nshould give seed to his brother.\n10 And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and he slew him\nalso.\n11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in thy father's\nhouse, till Shelah my son be grown up; for he said, Lest he also die, like his\nbrethren. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.\n12 And in process of time Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah\nwas comforted, and went up unto his sheep-shearers to Timnah, he and his friend\nHirah the Adullamite.\n13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah\nto shear his sheep.\n14 And she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself\nwith her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by\nthe way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given\nunto him to wife.\n15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; for she had covered her\nface.\n16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me come\nin unto thee: for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said,\nWhat wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?\n17 And he said, I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock. And she\nsaid, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?\n18 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet and thy\ncord, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave them to her, and came in\nunto her, and she conceived by him.\n19 And she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the\ngarments of her widowhood.\n20 And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,\nto receive the pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.\n21 Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute, that was\nat Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There hath been no prostitute here.\n22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her; and also the men of\nthe place said, There hath been no prostitute here.\n23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be put to shame: behold, I\nsent this kid, and thou hast not found her.\n24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying,\nTamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and moreover, behold, she is\nwith child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.\n25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the\nman, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose\nare these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff.\n26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She is more righteous than I,\nforasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.\n27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in\nher womb.\n28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand: and the\nmidwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out\nfirst.\n29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came\nout: and she said, Wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself? therefore his\nname was called Perez.\n30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his\nhand: and his name was called Zerah.\n\nChapter 39\n\n1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's,\nthe captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the\nIshmaelites, that had brought him down thither.\n2 And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the\nhouse of his master the Egyptian.\n3 And his master saw that Jehovah was with him, and that Jehovah made all that\nhe did to prosper in his hand.\n4 And Joseph found favor in his sight, and he ministered unto him: and he made\nhim overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.\n5 And it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and\nover all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's\nsake; and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had, in the house and in\nthe field.\n6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not aught [that was]\nwith him, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was comely, and\nwell-favored.\n7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes\nupon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.\n8 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master knoweth not\nwhat is with me in the house, and he hath put all that he hath into my hand:\n9 he is not greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back anything\nfrom me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great\nwickedness, and sin against God?\n10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not\nunto her, to lie by her, [or] to be with her.\n11 And it came to pass about this time, that he went into the house to do his\nwork; and there was none of the men of the house there within.\n12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his\ngarment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.\n13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand,\nand was fled forth,\n14 that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See,\nhe hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us: he came in unto me to lie with\nme, and I cried with a loud voice:\n15 and it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that\nhe left his garment by me, and fled, and got him out.\n16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.\n17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant,\nwhom thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:\n18 and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his\ngarment by me, and fled out.\n19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she\nspake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath\nwas kindled.\n20 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where\nthe king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.\n21 But Jehovah was with Joseph, and showed kindness unto him, and gave him favor\nin the sight of the keeper of the prison.\n22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners\nthat were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.\n23 The keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand,\nbecause Jehovah was with him; and that which he did, Jehovah made it to prosper.\n\nChapter 40\n\n1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt\nand his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt.\n2 And Pharaoh was wroth against his two officers, against the chief of the\nbutlers, and against the chief of the bakers.\n3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the\nprison, the place where Joseph was bound.\n4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he ministered unto\nthem: and they continued a season in ward.\n5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each\nman according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of\nthe king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.\n6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they\nwere sad.\n7 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in ward in his master's\nhouse, saying, Wherefore look ye so sad to-day?\n8 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can\ninterpret it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God?\ntell it me, I pray you.\n9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream,\nbehold, a vine was before me;\n10 and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, [and]\nits blossoms shot forth; [and] the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:\n11 and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them\ninto Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.\n12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: the three\nbranches are three days;\n13 within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto\nthine office: and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former\nmanner when thou wast his butler.\n14 But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and show\nkindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring\nme out of this house:\n15 for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also\nhave I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.\n16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto\nJoseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were\non my head:\n17 and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for\nPharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.\n18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: the three\nbaskets are three days;\n19 within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall\nhang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.\n20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made\na feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and\nthe head of the chief baker among his servants.\n21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the\ncup into Pharaoh's hand:\n22 but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.\n23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.\n\nChapter 41\n\n1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and,\nbehold, he stood by the river.\n2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, well-favored and\nfat-fleshed; and they fed in the reed-grass.\n3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill-favored\nand lean-fleshed, and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.\n4 And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-favored\nand fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.\n5 And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of grain came\nup upon one stalk, rank and good.\n6 And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after\nthem.\n7 And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh\nawoke, and, behold, it was a dream.\n8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent\nand called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and\nPharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto\nPharaoh.\n9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this\nday:\n10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the house of the\ncaptain of the guard, me and the chief baker:\n11 and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according\nto the interpretation of his dream.\n12 And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of\nthe guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man\naccording to his dream he did interpret.\n13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto\nmine office, and him he hanged.\n14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the\ndungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto\nPharaoh.\n15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that\ncan interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that when thou hearest a dream\nthou canst interpret it.\n16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh\nan answer of peace.\n17 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of\nthe river:\n18 and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed and\nwell-favored: and they fed in the reed-grass:\n19 and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill-favored\nand lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:\n20 and the lean and ill-favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:\n21 and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten\nthem; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.\n22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full\nand good:\n23 and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, [and] blasted with the east wind,\nsprung up after them:\n24 and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears: and I told it unto the\nmagicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.\n25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: what God is about\nto do he hath declared unto Pharaoh.\n26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years:\nthe dream is one.\n27 And the seven lean and ill-favored kine that came up after them are seven\nyears, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind; they shall be\nseven years of famine.\n28 That is the thing which I spake unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do he hath\nshowed unto Pharaoh.\n29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of\nEgypt:\n30 and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty\nshall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;\n31 and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which\nfolloweth; for it shall be very grievous.\n32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh, it is because the thing is\nestablished by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.\n33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over\nthe land of Egypt.\n34 Let Pharaoh do [this], and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take\nup the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.\n35 And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up\ngrain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.\n36 And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of\nfamine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through\nthe famine.\n37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his\nservants.\n38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in\nwhom the spirit of God is?\n39 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all of this,\nthere is none so discreet and wise as thou:\n40 thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people\nbe ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.\n41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of\nEgypt.\n42 And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's\nhand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his\nneck;\n43 and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had: and they cried\nbefore him, Bow the knee: and he set him over all the land of Egypt.\n44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man\nlift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.\n45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him to wife\nAsenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On. And Joseph went out over the\nland of Egypt.\n46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt.\nAnd Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the\nland of Egypt.\n47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.\n48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of\nEgypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was\nround about every city, laid he up in the same.\n49 And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off\nnumbering; for it was without number.\n50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom\nAsenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bare unto him.\n51 And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: For, [said he], God\nhath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.\n52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath made me fruitful\nin the land of my affliction.\n53 And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end.\n54 And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said:\nand there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.\n55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for\nbread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to\nyou, do.\n56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the\nstore-houses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land\nof Egypt.\n57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine\nwas sore in all the earth.\n\nChapter 42\n\n1 Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said unto his sons, Why\ndo ye look one upon another?\n2 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt: get you down\nthither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.\n3 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy grain from Egypt.\n4 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said,\nLest peradventure harm befall him.\n5 And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came: for the famine was\nin the land of Canaan.\n6 And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the\npeople of the land. And Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him\nwith their faces to the earth.\n7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto\nthem, and spake roughly with them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And\nthey said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.\n8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.\n9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them,\nYe are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.\n10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.\n11 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.\n12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.\n13 And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in\nthe land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and\none is not.\n14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are\nspies:\n15 hereby ye shall be proved: by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth\nhence, except your youngest brother come hither.\n16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that\nyour words may be proved, whether there be truth in you: or else by the life of\nPharaoh surely ye are spies.\n17 And he put them all together into ward three days.\n18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:\n19 if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house;\nbut go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses:\n20 and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and\nye shall not die. And they did so.\n21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in\nthat we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not\nhear; therefore is this distress come upon us.\n22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin\nagainst the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is\nrequired.\n23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter\nbetween them.\n24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and\nspake to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.\n25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every\nman's money into his sack, and to give them provisions for the way: and thus was\nit done unto them.\n26 And they laded their asses with their grain, and departed thence.\n27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the\nlodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his\nsack.\n28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in\nmy sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another,\nsaying, What is this that God hath done unto us?\n29 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him\nall that had befallen them, saying,\n30 The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies\nof the country.\n31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:\n32 we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is\nthis day with our father in the land of Canaan.\n33 And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye\nare true men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take [grain for] the\nfamine of your houses, and go your way;\n34 and bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no\nspies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye\nshall traffic in the land.\n35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's\nbundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their\nbundles of money, they were afraid.\n36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children:\nJoseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these\nthings are against me.\n37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him\nnot to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.\n38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and\nhe only is left: if harm befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye\nbring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.\n\nChapter 43\n\n1 And the famine was sore in the land.\n2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought\nout of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.\n3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us,\nsaying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.\n4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:\n5 but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down; for the man said unto us,\nYe shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.\n6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether\nye had yet a brother?\n7 And they said, The man asked straitly concerning ourselves, and concerning our\nkindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye [another] brother? and we\ntold him according to the tenor of these words: could we in any wise know that\nhe would say, Bring your brother down?\n8 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise\nand go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little\nones.\n9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him\nnot unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:\n10 for except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time.\n11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it be so now, do this: take of the\nchoice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a\nlittle balm, and a little honey, spicery and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;\n12 and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the\nmouth of your sacks carry again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:\n13 take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:\n14 and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release unto you\nyour other brother and Benjamin. And if I be bereaved of my children, I am\nbereaved.\n15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and\nBenjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.\n16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house,\nBring the men into the house, and slay, and make ready; for the men shall dine\nwith me at noon.\n17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men to Joseph's\nhouse.\n18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house; and\nthey said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time\nare we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and\ntake us for bondmen, and our asses.\n19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spake unto him\nat the door of the house,\n20 and said, Oh, my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:\n21 and it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our\nsacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in\nfull weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.\n22 And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food: we know not who\nput our money in our sacks.\n23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father,\nhath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon\nout unto them.\n24 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and\nthey washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.\n25 And they made ready the present against Joseph's coming at noon: for they\nheard that they should eat bread there.\n26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their\nhand into the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth.\n27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old\nman of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?\n28 And they said, Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive. And they\nbowed the head, and made obeisance.\n29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son,\nand said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said,\nGod be gracious unto thee, my son.\n30 And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned over his brother: and he sought\nwhere to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.\n31 And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said, Set\non bread.\n32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the\nEgyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not\neat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.\n33 And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the\nyoungest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one with another.\n34 And he took [and sent] messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess\nwas five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with\nhim. [\n\nChapter 44\n\n1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with\nfood, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.\n2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his\ngrain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.\n3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their\nasses.\n4 [ And] when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph\nsaid unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake\nthem, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?\n5 Is not this that in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye\nhave done evil in so doing.\n6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words.\n7 And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be\nit from thy servants that they should do such a thing.\n8 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto\nthee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house\nsilver or gold?\n9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be\nmy lord's bondmen.\n10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is\nfound shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless.\n11 Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened\nevery man his sack.\n12 And he searched, [and] began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and\nthe cup was found in Benjamin's sack.\n13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to\nthe city.\n14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; and he was yet there: and\nthey fell before him on the ground.\n15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not\nthat such a man as I can indeed divine?\n16 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how\nshall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants:\nbehold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is\nfound.\n17 And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the\ncup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto\nyour father.\n18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray\nthee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy\nservant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.\n19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?\n20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his\nold age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his\nmother; and his father loveth him.\n21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set\nmine eyes upon him.\n22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should\nleave his father, his father would die.\n23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down\nwith you, ye shall see my face no more.\n24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him\nthe words of my lord.\n25 And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.\n26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will\nwe go down; for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be\nwith us.\n27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two\nsons:\n28 and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I\nhave not seen him since:\n29 and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down\nmy gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.\n30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with\nus; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;\n31 it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not [with us], that he\nwill die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our\nfather with sorrow to Sheol.\n32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring\nhim not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever.\n33 Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a\nbondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.\n34 For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I see the\nevil that shall come on my father.\n\nChapter 45\n\n1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and\nhe cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him,\nwhile Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.\n2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.\n3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And\nhis brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.\n4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came\nnear. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.\n5 And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for\nGod did send me before you to preserve life.\n6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and there are yet five\nyears, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest.\n7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth, and to save\nyou alive by a great deliverance.\n8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a\nfather to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of\nEgypt.\n9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph,\nGod hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not;\n10 and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me,\nthou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy\nherds, and all that thou hast:\n11 and there will I nourish thee; for there are yet five years of famine; lest\nthou come to poverty, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast.\n12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is\nmy mouth that speaketh unto you.\n13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have\nseen: and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.\n14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept\nupon his neck.\n15 And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his\nbrethren talked with him.\n16 And the report thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's\nbrethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.\n17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye: lade your\nbeasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;\n18 and take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give\nyou the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.\n19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye: take you wagons out of the land of Egypt\nfor your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.\n20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.\n21 And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the\ncommandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.\n22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave\nthree hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.\n23 And to his father he sent after this manner: ten asses laden with the good\nthings of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with grain and bread and provision for\nhis father by the way.\n24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See\nthat ye fall not out by the way.\n25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob\ntheir father.\n26 And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the\nland of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he believed them not.\n27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and\nwhen he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob\ntheir father revived:\n28 and Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see\nhim before I die.\n\nChapter 46\n\n1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and\noffered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.\n2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob.\nAnd he said, Here am I.\n3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt;\nfor I will there make of thee a great nation:\n4 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up\nagain: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.\n5 And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their\nfather, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had\nsent to carry him.\n6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land\nof Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:\n7 his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters,\nand all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.\n8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob\nand his sons: Reuben, Jacob's first-born.\n9 And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.\n10 And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar,\nand Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.\n11 And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.\n12 And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; but Er\nand Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and\nHamul.\n13 And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron.\n14 And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.\n15 These are the sons of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his\ndaughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and\nthree.\n16 And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi,\nand Areli.\n17 And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah\ntheir sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel.\n18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these\nshe bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.\n19 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.\n20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom\nAsenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bare unto him.\n21 And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman,\nEhi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.\n22 These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were\nfourteen.\n23 And the sons of Dan: Hushim.\n24 And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.\n25 These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and\nthese she bare unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.\n26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, that came out of his loins,\nbesides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;\n27 and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls: all\nthe souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.\n28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to show the way before him unto\nGoshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.\n29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to\nGoshen; and he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his\nneck a good while.\n30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that\nthou art yet alive.\n31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up,\nand tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, who\nwere in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;\n32 and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they\nhave brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.\n33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What\nis your occupation?\n34 that ye shall say, Thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth\neven until now, both we, and our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of\nGoshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.\n\nChapter 47\n\n1 Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and\ntheir flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land\nof Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.\n2 And from among his brethren he took five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.\n3 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said\nunto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.\n4 And they said unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is\nno pasture for thy servants' flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of\nCanaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of\nGoshen.\n5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come\nunto thee:\n6 the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and\nthy brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest\nany able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.\n7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob\nblessed Pharaoh.\n8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life?\n9 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a\nhundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my\nlife, and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my\nfathers in the days of their pilgrimage.\n10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.\n11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in\nthe land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh\nhad commanded.\n12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's\nhousehold, with bread, according to their families.\n13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that\nthe land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.\n14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and\nin the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the\nmoney into Pharaoh's house.\n15 And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of\nCanaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why\nshould we die in thy presence? for [our] money faileth.\n16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if\nmoney fail.\n17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in\nexchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the\nasses: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that\nyear.\n18 And when that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said\nunto him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and\nthe herds of cattle are my lord's; there is nought left in the sight of my lord,\nbut our bodies, and our lands:\n19 wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and\nour land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give\nus seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate.\n20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold\nevery man his field, because the famine was sore upon them: and the land became\nPharaoh's.\n21 And as for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of the\nborder of Egypt even to the other end thereof.\n22 Only the land of the priests bought he not: for the priests had a portion\nfrom Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they\nsold not their land.\n23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your\nland for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.\n24 And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth\nunto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for\nyour food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.\n25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find favor in the sight of\nmy lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.\n26 And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that\nPharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone became not\nPharaoh's.\n27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gat\nthem possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.\n28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the days of Jacob,\nthe years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years.\n29 And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph,\nand said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy\nhand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray\nthee, in Egypt;\n30 but when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury\nme in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.\n31 And he said, Swear unto me: and he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself\nupon the bed's head.\n\nChapter 48\n\n1 And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph, Behold, thy\nfather is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.\n2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and\nIsrael strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.\n3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land\nof Canaan, and blessed me,\n4 and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I\nwill make of thee a company of peoples, and will give this land to thy seed\nafter thee for an everlasting possession.\n5 And now thy two sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I\ncame unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and\nSimeon, shall be mine.\n6 And thy issue, that thou begettest after them, shall be thine; they shall be\ncalled after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.\n7 And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of\nCanaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come unto Ephrath: and\nI buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).\n8 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?\n9 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me\nhere. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.\n10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he\nbrought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.\n11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God\nhath let me see thy seed also.\n12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with\nhis face to the earth.\n13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left\nhand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them\nnear unto him.\n14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who\nwas the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands\nwittingly; for Manasseh was the first-born.\n15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and\nIsaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long unto this day,\n16 the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name\nbe named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them\ngrow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.\n17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of\nEphraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from\nEphraim's head unto Manasseh's head.\n18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the\nfirst-born; put thy right hand upon his head.\n19 And his father refused, and said, I know [it], my son, I know [it] ; he also\nshall become a people, and he also shall be great: howbeit his younger brother\nshall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.\n20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God\nmake thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.\n21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God will be with you, and\nbring you again unto the land of your fathers.\n22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took\nout of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.\n\nChapter 49\n\n1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said: Gather yourselves together, that I\nmay tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days.\n2 Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; And hearken unto Israel your\nfather.\n3 Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength;\nThe pre-eminence of dignity, and the pre-eminence of power.\n4 Boiling over as water, thou shalt not have the pre-eminence; Because thou\nwentest up to thy father's bed; Then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.\n5 Simeon and Levi are brethren; Weapons of violence are their swords.\n6 O my soul, come not thou into their council; Unto their assembly, my glory, be\nnot thou united; For in their anger they slew a man, And in their self-will they\nhocked [ an ox.\n7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; And their wrath, for it was cruel: I\nwill divide them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel.\n8 Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise: Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine\nenemies; Thy father's sons shall bow down before thee.\n9 Judah is a lion's whelp; From the prey, my son, thou art gone up: He stooped\ndown, he couched as a lion, And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?\n10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler's staff from between\nhis feet, Until Shiloh come; And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be.\n11 Binding his foal unto the vine, And his ass's colt unto the choice vine; He\nhath washed his garments in wine, And his vesture in the blood of grapes:\n12 His eyes shall be red with wine, And his teeth white with milk.\n13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; And he shall be for a haven of\nships; And his border shall be upon Sidon.\n14 Issachar is a strong ass, Couching down between the sheepfolds:\n15 And he saw a resting-place that it was good, And the land that it was\npleasant; And he bowed his shoulder to bear, And became a servant under\ntaskwork.\n16 Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel.\n17 Dan shall be a serpent in the way, An adder in the path, That biteth the\nhorse's heels, So that his rider falleth backward.\n18 I have waited for thy salvation, O Jehovah.\n19 Gad, a troop shall press upon him; But he shall press upon their heel.\n20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, And he shall yield royal dainties.\n21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: He giveth goodly words.\n22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a fountain; His branches run\nover the wall.\n23 The archers have sorely grieved him, And shot at him, and persecuted him:\n24 But his bow abode in strength, And the arms of his hands were made strong, By\nthe hands of the Mighty One of Jacob (From thence is the shepherd, the stone of\nIsrael), [\n25 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, And by the Almighty, who\nshall bless thee, With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that\ncoucheth beneath, Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.\n26 The blessings of thy father Have prevailed above the blessings of my\nprogenitors Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: They shall be on the\nhead of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his\nbrethren.\n27 Benjamin is a wolf that raveneth: In the morning he shall devour the prey,\nAnd at even he shall divide the spoil.\n28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father\nspake unto them and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed\nthem.\n29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people:\nbury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,\n30 in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the\nland of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for\na possession of a burying-place.\n31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and\nRebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah--\n32 the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children\nof Heth.\n33 And when Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into\nthe bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.\n\nChapter 50\n\n1 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.\n2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the\nphysicians embalmed Israel.\n3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of\nembalming: and the Egyptians wept for him three-score and ten days.\n4 And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spake unto the house of\nPharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in\nthe ears of Pharaoh, saying,\n5 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged\nfor me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go\nup, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.\n6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.\n7 And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants\nof Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,\n8 and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only\ntheir little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of\nGoshen.\n9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great\ncompany.\n10 And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and\nthere they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation: and he made a\nmourning for his father seven days.\n11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the\nfloor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians:\nwherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.\n12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:\n13 for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave\nof the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession\nof a burying-place, of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.\n14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up\nwith him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.\n15 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, It may\nbe that Joseph will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil which we did\nunto him.\n16 And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he\ndied, saying,\n17 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of\nthy brethren, and their sin, for that they did unto thee evil. And now, we pray\nthee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And\nJoseph wept when they spake unto him.\n18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said,\nBehold, we are thy servants.\n19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?\n20 And as for you, ye meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring\nto pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.\n21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he\ncomforted them, and spake kindly unto them.\n22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived a\nhundred and ten years.\n23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also\nof Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph's knees.\n24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die; but God will surely visit you, and\nbring you up out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac,\nand to Jacob.\n25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely\nvisit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.\n26 So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and\nhe was put in a coffin in Egypt."}

And there was\nevening and there was morning, one day.\n6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it\ndivide the waters from the waters.\n7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the\nfirmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.\n8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was\nmorning, a second day.\n9 And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one\nplace, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.\n10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters\ncalled he Seas: and God saw that it was good.\n11 And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, [and]\nfruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon\nthe earth: and it was so.\n12 And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and\ntrees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind: and God saw\nthat it was good.\n13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.\n14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the\nday from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and\nyears:\n15 and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the\nearth: and it was so.\n16 And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the\nlesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also.\n17 And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,\n18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the\ndarkness: and God saw that it was good.\n19 And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.\n20 And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let\nbirds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.\n21 And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that\nmoveth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird\nafter its kind: and God saw that it was good.\n22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters\nin the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.\n23 And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.\n24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind,\ncattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it\nwas so.\n25 And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after\ntheir kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God\nsaw that it was good.\n26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them\nhave dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and\nover the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that\ncreepeth upon the earth.\n27 And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him;\nmale and female created he them.\n28 And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and\nreplenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea,\nand over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon\nthe earth.\n29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is\nupon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree\nyielding seed; to you it shall be for food:\n30 and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to\neverything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, [I have given]\nevery green herb for food: and it was so.\n31 And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And\nthere was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.\n\nChapter 2\n\n1 And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.\n2 And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested\non the seventh day from all his work which he had made.\n3 And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested\nfrom all his work which God had created and made.\n4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were\ncreated, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.\n5 And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had\nyet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and\nthere was not a man to till the ground;\n6 but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the\nground.\n7 And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his\nnostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\n8 And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man\nwhom he had formed.\n9 And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to\nthe sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden,\nand the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\n10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was\nparted, and became four heads.\n11 The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land\nof Havilah, where there is gold;\n12 and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.\n13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the\nwhole land of Cush.\n14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front\nof Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.\n15 And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it\nand to keep it.\n16 And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou\nmayest freely eat:\n17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it:\nfor in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\n18 And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will\nmake him a help meet for him.\n19 And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every\nbird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call\nthem: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name\nthereof.\n20 And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to\nevery beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help meet for him.\n21 And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and\nhe took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:\n22 and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and\nbrought her unto the man.\n23 And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she\nshall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.\n24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto\nhis wife: and they shall be one flesh.\n25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.\n\nChapter 3\n\n1 Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Jehovah God\nhad made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of\nany tree of the garden?\n2 And the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden\nwe may eat:\n3 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath\nsaid, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.\n4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:\n5 for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be\nopened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.\n6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a\ndelight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she\ntook of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with\nher, and he did eat.\n7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and\nthey sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.\n8 And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of\nthe day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah\nGod amongst the trees of the garden.\n9 And Jehovah God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou?\n10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was\nnaked; and I hid myself.\n11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree,\nwhereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?\n12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of\nthe tree, and I did eat.\n13 And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the\nwoman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\n14 And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed\nart thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly\nshalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:\n15 and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and\nher seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\n16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception;\nin pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband,\nand he shall rule over thee.\n17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy\nwife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt\nnot eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it\nall the days of thy life;\n18 thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the\nherb of the field;\n19 in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the\nground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt\nthou return.\n20 And the man called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all\nliving.\n21 And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed\nthem.\n22 And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good\nand evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of\nlife, and eat, and live for ever--\n23 therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the\nground from whence he was taken.\n24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the\nCherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of\nthe tree of life.\n\nChapter 4\n\n1 And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I\nhave gotten a man with [the help of] Jehovah.\n2 And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain\nwas a tiller of the ground.\n3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the\nground an offering unto Jehovah.\n4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat\nthereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering:\n5 but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth,\nand his countenance fell.\n6 And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance\nfallen?\n7 If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin\ncoucheth at the door; and unto thee shall be its desire; but do thou rule over\nit.\n8 And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the\nfield, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.\n9 And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know\nnot: am I my brother's keeper?\n10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth\nunto me from the ground.\n11 And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to\nreceive thy brother's blood from thy hand;\n12 when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its\nstrength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.\n13 And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.\n14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and\nfrom thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the\nearth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.\n15 And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall\nbe taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any\nfinding him should smite him.\n16 And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod,\non the east of Eden.\n17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a\ncity, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.\n18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael; and Mehujael begat\nMethushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.\n19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the\nname of the other Zillah.\n20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and [have]\ncattle.\n21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the\nharp and pipe.\n22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument\nof brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.\n23 And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of\nLamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a\nyoung man for bruising me:\n24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.\n25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth:\nFor, [said she], God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain\nslew him.\n26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh.\nThen began men to call upon the name of Jehovah.\n\nChapter 5\n\n1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man,\nin the likeness of God made he him;\n2 male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam,\nin the day when they were created.\n3 And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat [a son] in his own\nlikeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:\n4 and the days of Adam after he begat Seth were eight hundred years: and he\nbegat sons and daughters.\n5 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he\ndied.\n6 And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enosh:\n7 and Seth lived after he begat Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and begat\nsons and daughters:\n8 and all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.\n9 And Enosh lived ninety years, and begat Kenan:\n10 and Enosh lived after he begat Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and\nbegat sons and daughters:\n11 and all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years: and he died.\n12 And Kenan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalalel:\n13 and Kenan lived after he begat Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and\nbegat sons and daughters:\n14 and all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.\n15 And Mahalalel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:\n16 And Mahalalel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and\nbegat sons and daughters:\n17 and all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and\nhe died.\n18 And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and begat Enoch:\n19 and Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and\ndaughters:\n20 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.\n21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:\n22 and Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and\nbegat sons and daughters:\n23 and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:\n24 and Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.\n25 And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:\n26 and Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two\nyears, and begat sons and daughters:\n27 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he\ndied.\n28 And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:\n29 and he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us in our work\nand in the toil of our hands, [which cometh] because of the ground which Jehovah\nhath cursed.\n30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and\nbegat sons and daughters:\n31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he\ndied.\n32 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n\nChapter 6\n\n1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and\ndaughters were born unto them,\n2 that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they\ntook them wives of all that they chose.\n3 And Jehovah said, My Spirit shall not strive with man for ever, for that he\nalso is flesh: yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years. [\n4 The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the\nsons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them:\nthe same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.\n5 And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that\nevery imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\n6 And it repented Jehovah that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him\nat his heart.\n7 And Jehovah said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the\nground; both man, and beast, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; for\nit repenteth me that I have made them.\n8 But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.\n9 These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, [and] perfect in\nhis generations: Noah walked with God.\n10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n11 And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.\n12 And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had\ncorrupted their way upon the earth.\n13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth\nis filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the\nearth.\n14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt\npitch it within and without with pitch.\n15 And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred\ncubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.\n16 A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it\nupward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower,\nsecond, and third stories shalt thou make it.\n17 And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all\nflesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is in\nthe earth shall die.\n18 But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark,\nthou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.\n19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring\ninto the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.\n20 Of the birds after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every\ncreeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto\nthee, to keep them alive.\n21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and\nit shall be for food for thee, and for them.\n22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.\n\nChapter 7\n\n1 And Jehovah said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee\nhave I seen righteous before me in this generation.\n2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his\nfemale; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female:\n3 of the birds also of the heavens, seven and seven, male and female, to keep\nseed alive upon the face of all the earth.\n4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and\nforty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I destroy from off\nthe face of the ground.\n5 And Noah did according unto all that Jehovah commanded him.\n6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the\nearth.\n7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him,\ninto the ark, because of the waters of the flood.\n8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of\neverything that creepeth upon the ground,\n9 there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God\ncommanded Noah.\n10 And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were\nupon the earth.\n11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the\nseventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the\ngreat deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.\n12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.\n13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of\nNoah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;\n14 they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind,\nand every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every\nbird after its kind, every bird of every sort.\n15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is\nthe breath of life.\n16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded\nhim: and Jehovah shut him in.\n17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and\nbare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.\n18 And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark\nwent upon the face of the waters.\n19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high\nmountains that were under the whole heaven were covered.\n20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.\n21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both birds, and cattle, and\nbeasts, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:\n22 all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was\non the dry land, died.\n23 And every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of the ground,\nboth man, and cattle, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; and they\nwere destroyed from the earth: and Noah only was left, and they that were with\nhim in the ark.\n24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.\n\nChapter 8\n\n1 And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with\nhim in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters\nassuaged;\n2 the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the\nrain from heaven was restrained;\n3 and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of a\nhundred and fifty days the waters decreased.\n4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month,\nupon the mountains of Ararat.\n5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth\nmonth, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.\n6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of\nthe ark which he had made:\n7 and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were\ndried up from off the earth.\n8 And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off\nthe face of the ground;\n9 but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him\nto the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth\nhis hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark.\n10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of\nthe ark;\n11 and the dove came in to him at eventide; and, lo, in her mouth an olive-leaf\nplucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.\n12 And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she returned\nnot again unto him any more.\n13 And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month,\nthe first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and\nNoah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the\nground was dried.\n14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the\nearth dry.\n15 And God spake unto Noah, saying,\n16 Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives\nwith thee.\n17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both\nbirds, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that\nthey may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the\nearth.\n18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with\nhim:\n19 every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatsoever moveth upon the\nearth, after their families, went forth out of the ark.\n20 And Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah, and took of every clean beast, and of\nevery clean bird, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.\n21 And Jehovah smelled the sweet savor; and Jehovah said in his heart, I will\nnot again curse the ground any more for man's sake, for that the imagination of\nman's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more\neverything living, as I have done.\n22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and\nsummer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.\n\nChapter 9\n\n1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and\nmultiply, and replenish the earth.\n2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the\nearth, and upon every bird of the heavens; with all wherewith the ground\nteemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered.\n3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the green herb have I\ngiven you all.\n4 But flesh with the life thereof, [which is] the blood thereof, shall ye not\neat.\n5 And surely your blood, [the blood] of your lives, will I require; at the hand\nof every beast will I require it: and at the hand of man, even at the hand of\nevery man's brother, will I require the life of man.\n6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: For in the image\nof God made he man.\n7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth,\nand multiply therein.\n8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,\n9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;\n10 and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and\nevery beast of the earth with you; of all that go out of the ark, even every\nbeast of the earth.\n11 And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off\nany more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to\ndestroy the earth.\n12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and\nyou and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:\n13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant\nbetween me and the earth.\n14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow\nshall be seen in the cloud,\n15 and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living\ncreature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy\nall flesh.\n16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may\nremember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all\nflesh that is upon the earth.\n17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have\nestablished between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.\n18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and\nJapheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.\n19 These three were the sons of Noah: and of these was the whole earth\noverspread.\n20 And Noah began to be a husbandman, and planted a vineyard:\n21 and he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his\ntent.\n22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his\ntwo brethren without.\n23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders,\nand went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces\nwere backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.\n24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto\nhim.\n25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants shall he be unto his\nbrethren.\n26 And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem; And let Canaan be his\nservant.\n27 God enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan\nbe his servant.\n28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.\n29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: And he died.\n\nChapter 10\n\n1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, [namely], of Shem, Ham, and\nJapheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.\n2 The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and\nMeshech, and Tiras.\n3 And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.\n4 And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.\n5 Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after\nhis tongue, after their families, in their nations.\n6 And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.\n7 And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca;\nand the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan.\n8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.\n9 He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah: wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a\nmighty hunter before Jehovah.\n10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh,\nin the land of Shinar.\n11 Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and\nRehoboth-Ir, and Calah,\n12 and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).\n13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,\n14 and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (whence went forth the Philistines), and\nCaphtorim.\n15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,\n16 and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,\n17 and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,\n18 and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the\nfamilies of the Canaanite spread abroad.\n19 And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as thou goest toward Gerar,\nunto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto\nLasha.\n20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in\ntheir lands, in their nations.\n21 And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of\nJapheth, to him also were children born.\n22 The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram.\n23 And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.\n24 And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Eber.\n25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg; for in his\ndays was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.\n26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,\n27 and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,\n28 and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,\n29 and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.\n30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain\nof the east.\n31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in\ntheir lands, after their nations.\n32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their\nnations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.\n\nChapter 11\n\n1 And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.\n2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the\nland of Shinar; and they dwelt there.\n3 And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them\nthoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.\n4 And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top [may\nreach] unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon\nthe face of the whole earth.\n5 And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men\nbuilded.\n6 And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language;\nand this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them,\nwhich they purpose to do.\n7 Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not\nunderstand one another's speech.\n8 So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth:\nand they left off building the city.\n9 Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because Jehovah did there confound\nthe language of all the earth: and from thence did Jehovah scatter them abroad\nupon the face of all the earth.\n10 These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begat\nArpachshad two years after the flood:\n11 and Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad five hundred years, and begat sons\nand daughters.\n12 And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah:\n13 and Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three years, and\nbegat sons and daughters.\n14 And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:\n15 and Shelah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat\nsons and daughters.\n16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:\n17 and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat\nsons and daughters.\n18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:\n19 and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons\nand daughters.\n20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:\n21 and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat\nsons and daughters.\n22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:\n23 and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and\ndaughters.\n24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:\n25 and Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat\nsons and daughters.\n26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.\n27 Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran;\nand Haran begat Lot.\n28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of\nthe Chaldees.\n29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and\nthe name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah,\nand the father of Iscah.\n30 And Sarai was barren; she had no child.\n31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and\nSarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them\nfrom Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto\nHaran, and dwelt there.\n32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in\nHaran.\n\nChapter 12\n\n1 Now Jehovah said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy\nkindred, and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show thee:\n2 and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make they\nname great; and be thou a blessing:\n3 and I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse:\nand in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.\n4 So Abram went, as Jehovah had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and\nAbram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.\n5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their\nsubstance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran;\nand they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan\nthey came.\n6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the oak of\nMoreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.\n7 And Jehovah appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this\nland: and there builded he an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared unto him.\n8 And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and\npitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he\nbuilded an altar unto Jehovah, and called upon the name of Jehovah.\n9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.\n10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn\nthere; for the famine was sore in the land.\n11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said\nunto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:\n12 and it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will\nsay, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.\n13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy\nsake, and that my soul may live because of thee.\n14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians\nbeheld the woman that she was very fair.\n15 And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman\nwas taken into Pharaoh's house.\n16 And he dealt well with Abram for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and\nhe-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.\n17 And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of\nSarai, Abram's wife.\n18 And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me?\nwhy didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?\n19 why saidst thou, She is my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? now\ntherefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.\n20 And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way,\nand his wife, and all that he had.\n\nChapter 13\n\n1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot\nwith him, into the South.\n2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.\n3 And he went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el, unto the place\nwhere his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Ai,\n4 unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there\nAbram called on the name of Jehovah.\n5 And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.\n6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for\ntheir substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.\n7 And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen\nof Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.\n8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and\nthee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen; for we are brethren.\n9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if\n[thou wilt take] the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if [thou take]\nthe right hand, then I will go to the left.\n10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the Plain of the Jordan, that it\nwas well watered every where, before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like\nthe garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest unto Zoar.\n11 So Lot chose him all the Plain of the Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and\nthey separated themselves the one from the other.\n12 Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain,\nand moved his tent as far as Sodom.\n13 Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against Jehovah exceedingly.\n14 And Jehovah said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up\nnow thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward\nand eastward and westward:\n15 for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed\nfor ever.\n16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can\nnumber the dust of the earth, then may thy seed also be numbered.\n17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it;\nfor unto thee will I give it.\n18 And Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are\nin Hebron, and built there an altar unto Jehovah.\n\nChapter 14\n\n1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of\nEllasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,\n2 that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah,\nShinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the\nsame is Zoar).\n3 All these joined together in the vale of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea).\n4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they\nrebelled.\n5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with\nhim, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the\nEmim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,\n6 and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.\n7 And they returned, and came to En-mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and smote all\nthe country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in\nHazazon-tamar.\n8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king\nof Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar); and\nthey set the battle in array against them in the vale of Siddim;\n9 against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king\nof Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.\n10 Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and\nGomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain.\n11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals,\nand went their way.\n12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods,\nand departed.\n13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew: now he dwelt\nby the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and\nthese were confederate with Abram. [\n14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his\ntrained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far\nas Dan.\n15 And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote\nthem, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.\n16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot, and\nhis goods, and the women also, and the people.\n17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the\nslaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the vale of\nShaveh (the same is the King's Vale).\n18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was priest\nof God Most High.\n19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of\nheaven and earth:\n20 and blessed be God Most High, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.\nAnd he gave him a tenth of all.\n21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the\ngoods to thyself.\n22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah,\nGod Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,\n23 that I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine,\nlest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:\n24 save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men\nthat went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.\n\nChapter 15\n\n1 After these things the word of Jehovah came unto Abram in a vision, saying,\nFear not, Abram: I am thy shield, [and] thy exceeding great reward.\n2 And Abram said, O Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless,\nand he that shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?\n3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my\nhouse is mine heir.\n4 And, behold, the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying, This man shall not be\nthine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine\nheir.\n5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and number\nthe stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy\nseed be.\n6 And he believed in Jehovah; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.\n7 And he said unto him, I am Jehovah that brought thee out of Ur of the\nChaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.\n8 And he said, O Lord Jehovah, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?\n9 And he said unto him, Take me a heifer three years old, and a she-goat three\nyears old, and a ram three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.\n10 And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half\nover against the other: but the birds divided he not.\n11 And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them\naway.\n12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a\nhorror of great darkness fell upon him.\n13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be sojourners in\na land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them\nfour hundred years;\n14 and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward\nshall they come out with great substance.\n15 But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old\nage.\n16 And in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity\nof the Amorite is not yet full.\n17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a\nsmoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces.\n18 In that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I\ngiven this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river\nEuphrates:\n19 the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,\n20 and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,\n21 and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.\n\nChapter 16\n\n1 Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children: and she had a handmaid, an\nEgyptian, whose name was Hagar.\n2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, Jehovah hath restrained me from\nbearing; go in, I pray thee, unto my handmaid; it may be that I shall obtain\nchildren by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.\n3 And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram\nhad dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to\nbe his wife.\n4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had\nconceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.\n5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I gave my handmaid into thy\nbosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes:\nJehovah judge between me and thee.\n6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her that\nwhich is good in thine eyes. And Sarai dealt hardly with her, and she fled from\nher face.\n7 And the angel of Jehovah found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness,\nby the fountain in the way to Shur.\n8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, whence camest thou? and whither goest\nthou? And she said, I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.\n9 And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit\nthyself under her hands.\n10 And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, I will greatly multiply thy seed,\nthat it shall not be numbered for multitude.\n11 And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and\nshalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name Ishmael, because Jehovah hath\nheard thy affliction.\n12 And he shall be [as] a wild ass among men; his hand [shall be] against every\nman, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell over against all his\nbrethren.\n13 And she called the name of Jehovah that spake unto her, Thou art a God that\nseeth: for she said, Have I even here looked after him that seeth me?\n14 Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh\nand Bered.\n15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar\nbare, Ishmael.\n16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.\n\nChapter 17\n\n1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, Jehovah appeared to Abram, and\nsaid unto him, I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be thou perfect.\n2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee\nexceedingly.\n3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,\n4 As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be the father of a\nmultitude of nations.\n5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be\nAbraham; for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee.\n6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and\nkings shall come out of thee.\n7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee\nthroughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee\nand to thy seed after thee.\n8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy\nsojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will\nbe their God.\n9 And God said unto Abraham, And as for thee, thou shalt keep my covenant, thou,\nand thy seed after thee throughout their generations.\n10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed\nafter thee: every male among you shall be circumcised.\n11 And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a\ntoken of a covenant betwixt me and you.\n12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male\nthroughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money\nof any foreigner that is not of thy seed.\n13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must\nneeds be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting\ncovenant.\n14 And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his\nforeskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my\ncovenant.\n15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her\nname Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.\n16 And I will bless her, and moreover I will give thee a son of her: yea, I will\nbless her, and she shall be [a mother of] nations; kings of peoples shall be of\nher.\n17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a\nchild be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is\nninety years old, bear?\n18 And Abraham said unto God, Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!\n19 And God said, Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt\ncall his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an\neverlasting covenant for his seed after him. [\n20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: behold, I have blessed him, and will\nmake him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he\nbeget, and I will make him a great nation.\n21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee\nat this set time in the next year.\n22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.\n23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and\nall that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's\nhouse, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God\nhad said unto him.\n24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the\nflesh of his foreskin.\n25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the\nflesh of his foreskin.\n26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.\n27 And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with\nmoney of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.\n\nChapter 18\n\n1 And Jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door\nin the heat of the day;\n2 and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against\nhim: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed\nhimself to the earth,\n3 and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I\npray thee, from thy servant:\n4 let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves\nunder the tree:\n5 and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart; after that\nye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So\ndo, as thou hast said.\n6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly\nthree measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.\n7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it\nunto the servant; and he hasted to dress it.\n8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it\nbefore them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.\n9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the\ntent.\n10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round;\nand, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door,\nwhich was behind him.\n11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old, [and] well stricken in age; it had ceased to\nbe with Sarah after the manner of women.\n12 And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have\npleasure, my lord being old also?\n13 And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of\na surety bear a child, who am old?\n14 Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return unto thee,\nwhen the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son.\n15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said,\nNay; but thou didst laugh.\n16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went\nwith them to bring them on the way.\n17 And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;\n18 seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all\nthe nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?\n19 For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his\nhousehold after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness\nand justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he hath\nspoken of him.\n20 And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because\ntheir sin is very grievous;\n21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to\nthe cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.\n22 And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet\nbefore Jehovah.\n23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the\nwicked?\n24 Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and\nnot spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?\n25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the\nwicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee:\nshall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\n26 And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I\nwill spare all the place for their sake.\n27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto\nthe Lord, who am but dust and ashes:\n28 peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy\nall the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find\nthere forty and five.\n29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty\nfound there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty's sake.\n30 And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure\nthere shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find\nthirty there.\n31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord:\nperadventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy\nit for the twenty's sake.\n32 And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this\nonce: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it\nfor the ten's sake.\n33 And Jehovah went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham:\nand Abraham returned unto his place.\n\nChapter 19\n\n1 And the two angels came to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom:\nand Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face\nto the earth;\n2 and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into your servant's\nhouse, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and\ngo on your way. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.\n3 And he urged them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his\nhouse; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did\neat.\n4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, [even] the men of Sodom,\ncompassed the house round, both young and old, all the people from every\nquarter;\n5 and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men that came in to\nthee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.\n6 And Lot went out unto them to the door, and shut the door after him.\n7 And he said, I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly.\n8 Behold now, I have two daughters that have not known man; let me, I pray you,\nbring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto\nthese men do nothing, forasmuch as they are come under the shadow of my roof.\n9 And they said, Stand back. And they said, This one fellow came in to sojourn,\nand he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them.\nAnd they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and drew near to break the door.\n10 But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and\nshut to the door.\n11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness,\nboth small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.\n12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy\nsons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of\nthe place:\n13 for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxed great before\nJehovah; and Jehovah hath sent us to destroy it.\n14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons-in-law, who married his daughters,\nand said, Up, get you out of this place; for Jehovah will destroy the city. But\nhe seemed unto his sons-in-law as one that mocked.\n15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take\nthy wife, and thy two daughters that are here, lest thou be consumed in the\niniquity of the city.\n16 But he lingered; and the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of\nhis wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful unto\nhim: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.\n17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said,\nEscape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the Plain;\nescape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.\n18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my lord:\n19 behold now, thy servant hath found favor in thy sight, and thou hast\nmagnified thy lovingkindness, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life;\nand I cannot escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die:\n20 behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one. Oh let me\nescape thither (is it not a little one?), and my soul shall live.\n21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also,\nthat I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken.\n22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come\nthither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.\n23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came unto Zoar.\n24 Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from\nJehovah out of heaven;\n25 and he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of\nthe cities, and that which grew upon the ground.\n26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.\n27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he had stood\nbefore Jehovah:\n28 and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the\nPlain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a\nfurnace.\n29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God\nremembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he\noverthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.\n30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters\nwith him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two\ndaughters.\n31 And the first-born said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not\na man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:\n32 come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we\nmay preserve seed of our father.\n33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the first-born went in,\nand lay with her father; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.\n34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the first-born said unto the younger,\nBehold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night\nalso; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose,\nand lay with him; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.\n36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.\n37 And the first-born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the\nfather of the Moabites unto this day.\n38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same\nis the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.\n\nChapter 20\n\n1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt\nbetween Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar.\n2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of\nGerar sent, and took Sarah.\n3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, Behold,\nthou art but a dead man, because of the woman whom thou hast taken; for she is a\nman's wife.\n4 Now Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay even a\nrighteous nation?\n5 Said he not himself unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said,\nHe is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands\nhave I done this.\n6 And God said unto him in the dream, Yea, I know that in the integrity of thy\nheart thou has done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against me:\ntherefore suffered I thee not to touch her.\n7 Now therefore restore the man's wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray\nfor thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou\nshalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.\n8 And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told\nall these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.\n9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us?\nand wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my\nkingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.\n10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this\nthing?\n11 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this\nplace; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.\n12 And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the\ndaughter of my mother; and she became my wife:\n13 and it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house,\nthat I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me: at\nevery place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.\n14 And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants, and\ngave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.\n15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth\nthee.\n16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of\nsilver: behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee;\nand in respect of all thou art righted.\n17 And Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his\nmaid-servants; and they bare children.\n18 For Jehovah had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech,\nbecause of Sarah, Abraham's wife.\n\nChapter 21\n\n1 And Jehovah visited Sarah as he had said, and Jehovah did unto Sarah as he had\nspoken.\n2 And Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of\nwhich God had spoken to him.\n3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare\nto him, Isaac.\n4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had\ncommanded him.\n5 And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.\n6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh; every one that heareth will laugh\nwith me.\n7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give\nchildren suck? for I have borne him a son in his old age.\n8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast on the day\nthat Isaac was weaned.\n9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham,\nmocking.\n10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son: for the\nson of this handmaid shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.\n11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son.\n12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the\nlad, and because of thy handmaid; in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken\nunto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.\n13 And also of the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy\nseed.\n14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of\nwater, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and [gave her] the\nchild, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of\nBeer-sheba.\n15 And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of\nthe shrubs.\n16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a\nbowshot: for she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child. And she sat\nover against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.\n17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out\nof heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath\nheard the voice of the lad where he is.\n18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand; for I will make him a great\nnation.\n19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and\nfilled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.\n20 And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and\nbecame, as he grew up, an archer.\n21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out\nof the land of Egypt.\n22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of\nhis host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:\n23 now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with\nme, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I\nhave done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast\nsojourned.\n24 And Abraham said, I will swear.\n25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which\nAbimelech's servants had violently taken away.\n26 And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou\ntell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to-day.\n27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and they two\nmade a covenant.\n28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.\n29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou\nhast set by themselves?\n30 And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be\na witness unto me, that I have digged this well.\n31 Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of\nthem.\n32 So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the\ncaptain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.\n33 And [Abraham] planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the\nname of Jehovah, the Everlasting God.\n34 And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.\n\nChapter 22\n\n1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said\nunto him, Abraham; and he said, Here am I.\n2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac,\nand get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering\nupon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.\n3 And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of\nhis young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he clave the wood for the\nburnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.\n4 On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.\n5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the\nlad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come again to you.\n6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his\nson; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them\ntogether.\n7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said,\nHere am I, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood: but where is the\nlamb for a burnt-offering?\n8 And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my\nson: so they went both of them together.\n9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built the\naltar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him\non the altar, upon the wood.\n10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.\n11 And the angel of Jehovah called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham,\nAbraham: and he said, Here I am.\n12 And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto\nhim; for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy\nson, thine only son, from me.\n13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, behind [him] a ram\ncaught in the thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and\noffered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.\n14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to\nthis day, In the mount of Jehovah it shall be provided.\n15 And the angel of Jehovah called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven,\n16 and said, By myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah, because thou hast done this\nthing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son,\n17 that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy\nseed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore;\nand thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;\n18 and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou\nhast obeyed my voice.\n19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to\nBeer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.\n20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying,\nBehold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto thy brother Nahor:\n21 Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,\n22 and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.\n23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham's\nbrother.\n24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bare Tebah, and Gaham, and\nTahash, and Maacah.\n\nChapter 23\n\n1 And the life of Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years: these were the\nyears of the life of Sarah.\n2 And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan:\nand Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.\n3 And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spake unto the children of Heth,\nsaying,\n4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a\nburying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.\n5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,\n6 Hear us, my lord; thou art a prince of God among us: in the choice of our\nsepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but\nthat thou mayest bury thy dead.\n7 And Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the\nchildren of Heth.\n8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my\ndead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,\n9 that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end\nof his field; for the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you for a\npossession of a burying-place.\n10 Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Heth: and Ephron the\nHittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all\nthat went in at the gate of his city, saying,\n11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I\ngive it thee; in the presence of the children of my people give I it thee: bury\nthy dead.\n12 And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.\n13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying,\nBut if thou wilt, I pray thee, hear me: I will give the price of the field; take\nit of me, and I will bury my dead there.\n14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,\n15 My lord, hearken unto me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of\nsilver, what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.\n16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver\nwhich he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels\nof silver, current [money] with the merchant.\n17 So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the\nfield, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field,\nthat were in all the border thereof round about, were made sure\n18 unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before\nall that went in at the gate of his city.\n19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of\nMachpelah before Mamre (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan.\n20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for\na possession of a burying-place by the children of Heth.\n\nChapter 24\n\n1 And Abraham was old, [and] well stricken in age: and Jehovah had blessed\nAbraham in all things.\n2 And Abraham said unto his servant, the elder of his house, that ruled over all\nthat he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:\n3 and I will make thee swear by Jehovah, the God of heaven and the God of the\nearth, that thou wilt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the\nCanaanites, among whom I dwell:\n4 but thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my\nson Isaac.\n5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to\nfollow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from\nwhence thou camest?\n6 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither\nagain.\n7 Jehovah, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the\nland of my nativity, and who spake unto me, and who sware unto me, saying, Unto\nthy seed will I give this land; he will send his angel before thee, and thou\nshalt take a wife for my son from thence.\n8 And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from\nthis my oath; only thou shalt not bring my son thither again.\n9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware\nto him concerning this matter.\n10 And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed,\nhaving all goodly things of his master's in his hand: and he arose, and went to\nMesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.\n11 And he made the camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at\nthe time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.\n12 And he said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray thee,\ngood speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham.\n13 Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water; and the daughters of the men\nof the city are coming out to draw water:\n14 and let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy\npitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will\ngive thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy\nservant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my\nmaster.\n15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came\nout, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's\nbrother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.\n16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man\nknown her: and she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came\nup.\n17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a\nlittle water from thy pitcher.\n18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon\nher hand, and gave him drink.\n19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy camels\nalso, until they have done drinking.\n20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto\nthe well to draw, and drew for all his camels.\n21 And the man looked stedfastly on her, holding his peace, to know whether\nJehovah had made his journey prosperous or not.\n22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a\ngolden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten\nshekels weight of gold,\n23 and said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy\nfather's house for us to lodge in?\n24 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom\nshe bare unto Nahor.\n25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room\nto lodge in.\n26 And the man bowed his head, and worshipped Jehovah.\n27 And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who hath not\nforsaken his lovingkindness and his truth toward my master: as for me, Jehovah\nhath led me in the way to the house of my master's brethren.\n28 And the damsel ran, and told her mother's house according to these words.\n29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the\nman, unto the fountain.\n30 And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his\nsister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus\nspake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he was standing\nby the camels at the fountain.\n31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of Jehovah; wherefore standest thou\nwithout? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.\n32 And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels; and he gave\nstraw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of\nthe men that were with him.\n33 And there was set food before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until\nI have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.\n34 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.\n35 And Jehovah hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he\nhath given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and men-servants and\nmaid-servants, and camels and asses.\n36 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto\nhim hath he given all that he hath.\n37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of\nthe daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:\n38 but thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife\nfor my son.\n39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.\n40 And he said unto me, Jehovah, before whom I walk, will send his angel with\nthee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred,\nand of my father's house:\n41 then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if\nthey give her not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath.\n42 And I came this day unto the fountain, and said, O Jehovah, the God of my\nmaster Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:\n43 behold, I am standing by the fountain of water; and let it come to pass, that\nthe maiden that cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee,\na little water from thy pitcher to drink;\n44 and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy\ncamels: let the same be the woman whom Jehovah hath appointed for my master's\nson.\n45 And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with\nher pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the fountain, and drew: and\nI said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.\n46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said,\nDrink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the\ncamels drink also.\n47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The\ndaughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the ring\nupon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands.\n48 And I bowed my head, and worshipped Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah, the God of\nmy master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's\ndaughter for his son.\n49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not,\ntell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.\n50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from Jehovah:\nwe cannot speak unto thee bad or good.\n51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's\nson's wife, as Jehovah hath spoken.\n52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed\nhimself down to the earth unto Jehovah.\n53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and\nraiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother\nprecious things.\n54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried\nall night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my\nmaster.\n55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us [a few]\ndays, at the least ten; after that she shall go.\n56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing Jehovah hath prospered my way;\nsend me away that I may go to my master.\n57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.\n58 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And\nshe said, I will go.\n59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's\nservant, and his men.\n60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Our sister, be thou [the mother]\nof thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those that\nhate them.\n61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and\nfollowed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.\n62 And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the land of\nthe South.\n63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up\nhis eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.\n64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the\ncamel.\n65 And she said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to\nmeet us? And the servant said, It is my master: and she took her veil, and\ncovered herself.\n66 And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.\n67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she\nbecame his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's\ndeath.\n\nChapter 25\n\n1 And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.\n2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and\nShuah.\n3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and\nLetushim, and Leummim.\n4 And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah.\nAll these were the children of Keturah.\n5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.\n6 But unto the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and\nhe sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the\neast country.\n7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a\nhundred threescore and fifteen years.\n8 And Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and\nfull [of years], and was gathered to his people.\n9 And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the\nfield of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;\n10 the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth: there was Abraham\nburied, and Sarah his wife.\n11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his\nson: and Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi.\n12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the\nEgyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:\n13 and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to\ntheir generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel,\nand Mibsam,\n14 and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,\n15 Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:\n16 these are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages,\nand by their encampments; twelve princes according to their nations.\n17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and\nseven years: and he gave up the ghost and died, and was gathered unto his\npeople.\n18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest\ntoward Assyria: he abode over against all his brethren.\n19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:\n20 and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel\nthe Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.\n21 And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren: and Jehovah\nwas entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.\n22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so,\nwherefore do I live? And she went to inquire of Jehovah.\n23 And Jehovah said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, And two peoples shall\nbe separated from thy bowels: And the one people shall be stronger than the\nother people; And the elder shall serve the younger.\n24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in\nher womb.\n25 And the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called\nhis name Esau.\n26 And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel;\nand his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare\nthem.\n27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field; and\nJacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.\n28 Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: and Rebekah loved\nJacob.\n29 And Jacob boiled pottage: and Esau came in from the field, and he was faint:\n30 and Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red [pottage] ;\nfor I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.\n31 And Jacob said, Sell me first thy birthright.\n32 And Esau said, Behold, I am about to die: and what profit shall the\nbirthright do to me?\n33 And Jacob said, Swear to me first; and he sware unto him: and he sold his\nbirthright unto Jacob.\n34 And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink,\nand rose up, and went his way: so Esau despised his birthright.\n\nChapter 26\n\n1 And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the\ndays of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto\nGerar.\n2 And Jehovah appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the\nland which I shall tell thee of:\n3 sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto\nthee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the\noath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;\n4 and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy\nseed all these lands; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be\nblessed;\n5 because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my\nstatutes, and my laws.\n6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:\n7 and the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister:\nfor he feared to say, My wife; lest, [said he], the men of the place should kill\nme for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.\n8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king\nof the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was\nsporting with Rebekah his wife.\n9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and\nhow saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest\nI die because of her.\n10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? One of the people\nmight easily have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness\nupon us.\n11 And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that toucheth this man or\nhis wife shall surely be put to death.\n12 And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold: and\nJehovah blessed him.\n13 And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great:\n14 and he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great\nhousehold: and the Philistines envied him.\n15 Now all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of\nAbraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.\n16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than\nwe.\n17 And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt\nthere.\n18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days\nof Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of\nAbraham; and he called their names after the names by which his father had\ncalled them.\n19 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of\nspringing water.\n20 And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is\nours: and he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.\n21 And they digged another well, and they strove for that also: and he called\nthe name of it Sitnah.\n22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove\nnot: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now Jehovah hath\nmade room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.\n23 And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.\n24 And Jehovah appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of\nAbraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and\nmultiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.\n25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of Jehovah, and\npitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.\n26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol\nthe captain of his host.\n27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me,\nand have sent me away from you?\n28 And they said, We saw plainly that Jehovah was with thee: and we said, Let\nthere now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a\ncovenant with thee,\n29 that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have\ndone unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now\nthe blessed of Jehovah.\n30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.\n31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac\nsent them away, and they departed from him in peace.\n32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him\nconcerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found\nwater.\n33 And he called it Shibah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto\nthis day.\n34 And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of\nBeeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:\n35 and they were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.\n\nChapter 27\n\n1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that\nhe could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said unto him, My son: and\nhe said unto him, Here am I.\n2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.\n3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go\nout to the field, and take me venison;\n4 and make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat;\nthat my soul may bless thee before I die.\n5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field\nto hunt for venison, and to bring it.\n6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak\nunto Esau thy brother, saying,\n7 Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless thee\nbefore Jehovah before my death.\n8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.\n9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and\nI will make them savory food for thy father, such as he loveth:\n10 and thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless\nthee before his death.\n11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man,\nand I am a smooth man.\n12 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver;\nand I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.\n13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son; only obey my\nvoice, and go fetch me them.\n14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made\nsavory food, such as his father loved.\n15 And Rebekah took the goodly garments of Esau her elder son, which were with\nher in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son;\n16 and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the\nsmooth of his neck:\n17 and she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the\nhand of her son Jacob.\n18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who\nart thou, my son?\n19 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I have done\naccording as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that\nthy soul may bless me.\n20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my\nson? And he said, Because Jehovah thy God sent me good speed.\n21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my\nson, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.\n22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The\nvoice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.\n23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's\nhands: so he blessed him.\n24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.\n25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my\nsoul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he\nbrought him wine, and he drank.\n26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.\n27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment,\nand blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son Is as the smell of a field\nwhich Jehovah hath blessed:\n28 And God give thee of the dew of heaven, And of the fatness of the earth, And\nplenty of grain and new wine:\n29 Let peoples serve thee, And nations bow down to thee: Be lord over thy\nbrethren, And let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: Cursed be every one that\ncurseth thee, And blessed be every one that blesseth thee.\n30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and\nJacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau\nhis brother came in from his hunting.\n31 And he also made savory food, and brought it unto his father; and he said\nunto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy\nsoul may bless me.\n32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son,\nthy first-born, Esau.\n33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who then is he that hath taken\nvenison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have\nblessed him? yea, [and] he shall be blessed.\n34 When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and\nbitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.\n35 And he said, Thy brother came with guile, and hath taken away thy blessing.\n36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these\ntwo times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my\nblessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?\n37 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and\nall his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with grain and new wine\nhave I sustained him: and what then shall I do for thee, my son?\n38 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? Bless\nme, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.\n39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, of the fatness of\nthe earth shall be thy dwelling, And of the dew of heaven from above;\n40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and thou shalt serve thy brother; And it\nshall come to pass, when thou shalt break loose, That thou shalt shake his yoke\nfrom off thy neck.\n41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed\nhim: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand;\nthen will I slay my brother Jacob.\n42 And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah; and she sent and\ncalled Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as\ntouching thee, doth comfort himself, [purposing] to kill thee.\n43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my\nbrother to Haran;\n44 and tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;\n45 until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou\nhast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be\nbereaved of you both in one day?\n46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of\nHeth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the\ndaughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?\n\nChapter 28\n\n1 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him,\nThou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.\n2 Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and\ntake thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.\n3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that\nthou mayest be a company of peoples;\n4 and give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee;\nthat thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto\nAbraham.\n5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Paddan-aram unto Laban, son of\nBethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.\n6 Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram, to\ntake him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge,\nsaying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;\n7 and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram:\n8 and Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;\n9 and Esau went unto Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath\nthe daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.\n10 And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.\n11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the\nsun was set; and he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his\nhead, and lay down in that place to sleep.\n12 And he dreamed; and behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it\nreached to heaven; and, behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on\nit.\n13 And, behold, Jehovah stood above it, and said, I am Jehovah, the God of\nAbraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee\nwill I give it, and to thy seed;\n14 and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad\nto the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee\nand in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.\n15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest, and\nwill bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have\ndone that which I have spoken to thee of.\n16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Jehovah is in this\nplace; and I knew it not.\n17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other\nthan the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\n18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put\nunder his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.\n19 And he called the name of that place Beth-el: but the name of the city was\nLuz at the first.\n20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in\nthis way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,\n21 so that I come again to my father's house in peace, and Jehovah will be my\nGod,\n22 then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house: and\nof all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.\n\nChapter 29\n\n1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the\neast.\n2 And he looked, and, behold, a well in the field, and, lo, three flocks of\nsheep lying there by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and the\nstone upon the well's mouth was great.\n3 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the\nwell's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's\nmouth in its place.\n4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, Of Haran\nare we.\n5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know\nhim.\n6 And he said unto them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well: and,\nbehold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.\n7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should\nbe gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.\n8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they\nroll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.\n9 While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for\nshe kept them.\n10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's\nbrother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and\nrolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his\nmother's brother.\n11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.\n12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was\nRebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.\n13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son,\nthat he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to\nhis house. And he told Laban all these things.\n14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode\nwith him the space of a month.\n15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou\ntherefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?\n16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of\nthe younger was Rachel.\n17 And Leah's eyes were tender; but Rachel was beautiful and well-favored.\n18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel\nthy younger daughter.\n19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give\nher to another man: abide with me.\n20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few\ndays, for the love he had to her.\n21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I\nmay go in unto her.\n22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.\n23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and\nbrought her to him; and he went in unto her.\n24 And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid.\n25 And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah: and he said to\nLaban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for\nRachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?\n26 And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before\nthe first-born.\n27 Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the\nservice which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.\n28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter\nto wife.\n29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid.\n30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and\nserved with him yet seven other years.\n31 And Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb: but Rachel was\nbarren.\n32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she\nsaid, Because Jehovah hath looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will\nlove me.\n33 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and said, Because Jehovah hath heard\nthat I am hated, he hath therefore given me this [son] also: and she called his\nname Simeon.\n34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my\nhusband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons: therefore was\nhis name called Levi.\n35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, This time will I\npraise Jehovah: therefore she called his name Judah; and she left off bearing.\n\nChapter 30\n\n1 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister;\nand she said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.\n2 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's\nstead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?\n3 And she said, Behold, my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; that she may bear upon\nmy knees, and I also may obtain children by her.\n4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.\n5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.\n6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath\ngiven me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.\n7 And Bilhah Rachel's handmaid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.\n8 And Rachel said, With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and\nhave prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.\n9 When Leah saw that she had left off bearing, she took Zilpah her handmaid, and\ngave her to Jacob to wife.\n10 And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bare Jacob a son.\n11 And Leah said, Fortunate! and she called his name Gad.\n12 And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bare Jacob a second son.\n13 And Leah said, Happy am I! for the daughters will call me happy: and she\ncalled his name Asher.\n14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the\nfield, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me,\nI pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes. [\n15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my\nhusband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said,\nTherefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son's mandrakes.\n16 And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him,\nand said, Thou must come in unto me; for I have surely hired thee with my son's\nmandrakes. And he lay with her that night.\n17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob a fifth son.\n18 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my\nhusband: and she called his name Issachar.\n19 And Leah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Jacob.\n20 And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband\ndwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name\nZebulun.\n21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.\n22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.\n23 And she conceived, and bare a son: and said, God hath taken away my reproach:\n24 and she called his name Joseph, saying, Jehovah add to me another son.\n25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto\nLaban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.\n26 Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go:\nfor thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee.\n27 And Laban said unto him, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, [tarry] :\n[for] I have divined that Jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake.\n28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.\n29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle\nhave fared with me.\n30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it hath increased unto\na multitude; and Jehovah hath blessed thee whithersoever I turned: and now when\nshall I provide for mine own house also?\n31 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me\naught: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep\nit.\n32 I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence every speckled\nand spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and\nspeckled among the goats: and [of such] shall be my hire.\n33 So shall my righteousness answer for me hereafter, when thou shalt come\nconcerning my hire that is before thee: every one that is not speckled and\nspotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that, [if found] with me,\nshall be counted stolen.\n34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.\n35 And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and\nall the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in\nit, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his\nsons;\n36 and he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the\nrest of Laban's flocks.\n37 And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the\nplane-tree; and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which\nwas in the rods.\n38 And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the\ngutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they\nconceived when they came to drink.\n39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth\nringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.\n40 And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the\nringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves\napart, and put them not unto Laban's flock.\n41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that\nJacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might\nconceive among the rods;\n42 but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were\nLaban's, and the stronger Jacob's.\n43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants\nand men-servants, and camels and asses.\n\nChapter 31\n\n1 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that\nwas our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this\nglory.\n2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him\nas beforetime.\n3 And Jehovah said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy\nkindred; and I will be with thee.\n4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,\n5 and said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me\nas beforetime; but the God of my father hath been with me.\n6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.\n7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God\nsuffered him not to hurt me.\n8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bare\nspeckled: and if he said thus, The ringstreaked shall be thy wages; then bare\nall the flock ringstreaked.\n9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.\n10 And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceive, that I lifted up\nmine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the\nflock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled.\n11 And the angel of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here am I.\n12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see: all the he-goats which leap\nupon the flock are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all\nthat Laban doeth unto thee.\n13 I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a\nvow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of\nthy nativity.\n14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or\ninheritance for us in our father's house?\n15 Are we not accounted by him as foreigners? for he hath sold us, and hath also\nquite devoured our money.\n16 For all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, that is ours\nand our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.\n17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;\n18 and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had\ngathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go\nto Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan.\n19 Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that\nwere her father's.\n20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not\nthat he fled.\n21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the River,\nand set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.\n22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.\n23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey;\nand he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.\n24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said unto him,\nTake heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n25 And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain:\nand Laban with his brethren encamped in the mountain of Gilead.\n26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away\nunawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?\n27 Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not\ntell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret\nand with harp;\n28 and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast thou done\nfoolishly.\n29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father\nspake unto me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to\nJacob either good or bad.\n30 And now, [though] thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst\nafter thy father's house, [yet] wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?\n31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Lest\nthou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force.\n32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live: before our brethren\ndiscern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that\nRachel had stolen them.\n33 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of\nthe two maid-servants; but he found them not. And he went out of Leah's tent,\nand entered into Rachel's tent.\n34 Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel's saddle, and\nsat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not.\n35 And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up\nbefore thee; for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not\nthe teraphim.\n36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to\nLaban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after\nme?\n37 Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy\nhousehold stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may\njudge betwixt us two.\n38 These twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not\ncast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten.\n39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it;\nof my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.\n40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and\nmy sleep fled from mine eyes.\n41 These twenty years have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for\nthy two daughters, and six years for thy flock: and thou hast changed my wages\nten times.\n42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had\nbeen with me, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. God hath seen mine\naffliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.\n43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and\nthe children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou\nseest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their\nchildren whom they have borne?\n44 And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness\nbetween me and thee.\n45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.\n46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and\nmade a heap: and they did eat there by the heap.\n47 And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.\n48 And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore\nwas the name of it called Galeed:\n49 and Mizpah, for he said, Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we are\nabsent one from another.\n50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives besides my\ndaughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.\n51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I\nhave set betwixt me and thee.\n52 This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over\nthis heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar\nunto me, for harm.\n53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge\nbetwixt us. And Jacob sware by the Fear of his father Isaac.\n54 And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat\nbread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.\n55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his\ndaughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.\n\nChapter 32\n\n1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\n2 And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God's host: and he called the name of\nthat place Mahanaim.\n3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of\nSeir, the field of Edom.\n4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith\nthy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now:\n5 and I have oxen, and asses, [and] flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants:\nand I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.\n6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and\nmoreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.\n7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people\nthat were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two\ncompanies;\n8 and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company\nwhich is left shall escape.\n9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O\nJehovah, who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I\nwill do thee good:\n10 I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the\ntruth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over\nthis Jordan; and now I am become two companies.\n11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau:\nfor I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.\n12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of\nthe sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.\n13 And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a\npresent for Esau his brother:\n14 two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,\n15 thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty\nshe-asses and ten foals.\n16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself,\nand said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove\nand drove.\n17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and\nasketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these\nbefore thee?\n18 then thou shalt say, [They are] thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent\nunto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us.\n19 And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the\ndroves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;\n20 and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he\nsaid, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I\nwill see his face; peradventure he will accept me.\n21 So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in\nthe company.\n22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and\nhis eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.\n23 And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he\nhad.\n24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the\nbreaking of the day.\n25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of\nhis thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with\nhim.\n26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let\nthee go, except thou bless me.\n27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.\n28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou\nhast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.\n29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said,\nWherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.\n30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, [said he], I have seen\nGod face to face, and my life is preserved.\n31 And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his\nthigh.\n32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon\nthe hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's\nthigh in the sinew of the hip.\n\nChapter 33\n\n1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and\nwith him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto\nRachel, and unto the two handmaids.\n2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her\nchildren after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.\n3 And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven\ntimes, until he came near to his brother.\n4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed\nhim: and they wept.\n5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who\nare these with thee? And he said, The children whom God hath graciously given\nthy servant.\n6 Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed\nthemselves.\n7 And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came\nJoseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.\n8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this company which I met? And he said,\nTo find favor in the sight of my lord.\n9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let that which thou hast be thine.\n10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found favor in thy sight,\nthen receive my present at my hand; forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one\nseeth the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.\n11 Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt\ngraciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.\n12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before\nthee.\n13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and that\nthe flocks and herds with me have their young: and if they overdrive them one\nday, all the flocks will die.\n14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on\ngently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to\nthe pace of the children, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.\n15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me.\nAnd he said, What needeth it? let me find favor in the sight of my lord.\n16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.\n17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for\nhis cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.\n18 And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of\nCanaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city.\n19 And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand\nof the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money.\n20 And he erected there an altar, and called it El-Elohe-Israel.\n\nChapter 34\n\n1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the\ndaughters of the land.\n2 And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; and\nhe took her, and lay with her, and humbled her.\n3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel,\nand spake kindly unto the damsel.\n4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.\n5 Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with\nhis cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they came.\n6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.\n7 And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it: and the men\nwere grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel\nin lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.\n8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for\nyour daughter: I pray you, give her unto him to wife.\n9 And make ye marriages with us; give your daughters unto us, and take our\ndaughters unto you.\n10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade\nye therein, and get you possessions therein.\n11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find favor in\nyour eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.\n12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall\nsay unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.\n13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and\nspake, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,\n14 and said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that\nis uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us.\n15 Only on this condition will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we are,\nthat every male of you be circumcised;\n16 then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to\nus, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.\n17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our\ndaughter, and we will be gone.\n18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.\n19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in\nJacob's daughter: and he was honored above all the house of his father.\n20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed\nwith the men of their city, saying,\n21 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and\ntrade therein; for, behold, the land is large enough for them; let us take their\ndaughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.\n22 Only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to\nbecome one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are\ncircumcised.\n23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours? only\nlet us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.\n24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the\ngate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate\nof his city.\n25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the\nsons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and\ncame upon the city unawares, and slew all the males.\n26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took\nDinah out of Shechem's house, and went forth.\n27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they\nhad defiled their sister.\n28 They took their flocks and their herds and their asses, and that which was in\nthe city, and that which was in the field;\n29 and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, took they\ncaptive and made a prey, even all that was in the house.\n30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me odious to\nthe inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and, I\nbeing few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite\nme; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.\n31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?\n\nChapter 35\n\n1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make\nthere an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face\nof Esau thy brother.\n2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away\nthe foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your\ngarments:\n3 and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto\nGod, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which\nI went.\n4 And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and\nthe rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was\nby Shechem.\n5 And they journeyed: and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round\nabout them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.\n6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Beth-el), he\nand all the people that were with him.\n7 And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there\nGod was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.\n8 And Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the\noak: and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth.\n9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed\nhim.\n10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any\nmore Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.\n11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation\nand a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy\nloins;\n12 and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and\nto thy seed after thee will I give the land.\n13 And God went up from him in the place where he spake with him.\n14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spake with him, a pillar of\nstone: and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon.\n15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el.\n16 And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some distance to come to\nEphrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.\n17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto\nher, Fear not; for now thou shalt have another son.\n18 And it came to pass, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she\ncalled his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.\n19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is\nBeth-lehem).\n20 And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave: the same is the Pillar of Rachel's\ngrave unto this day.\n21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.\n22 And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and\nlay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of\nJacob were twelve:\n23 the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and\nJudah, and Issachar, and Zebulun;\n24 the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;\n25 and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid: Dan and Naphtali;\n26 and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad and Asher: these are the sons of\nJacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram.\n27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is\nHebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.\n28 And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years.\n29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old\nand full of days: and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.\n\nChapter 36\n\n1 Now these are the generations of Esau (the same is Edom).\n2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the\nHittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,\n3 and Basemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth.\n4 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Basemath bare Reuel;\n5 and Oholibamah bare Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau,\nthat were born unto him in the land of Canaan.\n6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of\nhis house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his possessions, which he\nhad gathered in the land of Canaan; and went into a land away from his brother\nJacob.\n7 For their substance was too great for them to dwell together; and the land of\ntheir sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle.\n8 And Esau dwelt in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.\n9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount\nSeir:\n10 these are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau,\nReuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau.\n11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.\n12 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son;

these are the sons of Adah.\n17 And these are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief\nShammah, chief Mizzah: these are the chiefs that came of Reuel in the land of\nEdom; these are the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife.\n18 And these are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau's wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam,\nchief Korah: these are the chiefs that came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah,\nEsau's wife.\n19 These are the sons of Esau, and these are their chiefs: the same is Edom.\n20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and\nShobal and Zibeon and Anah,\n21 and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan: these are the chiefs that came of the\nHorites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.\n22 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Heman; and Lotan's sister was Timna.\n23 And these are the children of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and\nOnam.\n24 And these are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah; this is Anah who found\nthe hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.\n25 And these are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of\nAnah.\n26 And these are the children of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and\nCheran.\n27 These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan.\n28 These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran.\n29 These are the chiefs that came of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal,\nchief Zibeon, chief Anah,\n30 chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan: these are the chiefs that came of the\nHorites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.\n31 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there\nreigned any king over the children of Israel.\n32 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was\nDinhabah.\n33 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.\n34 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead.\n35 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of\nMoab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.\n36 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.\n37 And Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the River reigned in his stead.\n38 And Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.\n39 And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and\nthe name of his city was Pau;

This is Esau, the father of the\nEdomites.\n\nChapter 37\n\n1 And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of\nCanaan.\n2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was\nfeeding the flock with his brethren; and he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah,\nand with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought the evil\nreport of them unto their father.\n3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of\nhis old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.\n4 And his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren;\nand they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.\n5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren: and they hated him\nyet the more.\n6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:\n7 for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose,\nand also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves came round about, and made\nobeisance to my sheaf.\n8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou\nindeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams,\nand for his words.\n9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said,\nBehold, I have dreamed yet a dream: and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven\nstars made obeisance to me.\n10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked\nhim, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and\nthy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the\nearth?\n11 And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying in mind.\n12 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.\n13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Are not thy brethren feeding the flock in\nShechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.\n14 And he said to him, Go now, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and\nwell with the flock; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of\nHebron, and he came to Shechem.\n15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and\nthe man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?\n16 And he said, I am seeking my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they are\nfeeding [the flock] .\n17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to\nDothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.\n18 And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired\nagainst him to slay him.\n19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.\n20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits,\nand we will say, An evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will\nbecome of his dreams.\n21 And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us\nnot take his life.\n22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in\nthe wilderness, but lay no hand upon him: that he might deliver him out of their\nhand, to restore him to his father.\n23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they\nstripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;\n24 and they took him, and cast him into the pit: and the pit was empty, there\nwas no water in it.\n25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked,\nand, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels\nbearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.\n26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother\nand conceal his blood?\n27 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon\nhim; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened unto him.\n28 And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up\nJoseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of\nsilver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.\n29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and\nhe rent his clothes.\n30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither\nshall I go?\n31 And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the\nblood;\n32 and they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father,\nand said, This have we found: know now whether it is thy son's coat or not.\n33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured\nhim; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.\n34 And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned\nfor his son many days.\n35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused\nto be comforted; and he said, For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning.\nAnd his father wept for him.\n36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of\nPharaoh's, the captain of the guard.\n\nChapter 38\n\n1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and\nturned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.\n2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; and\nhe took her, and went in unto her.\n3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.\n4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.\n5 And she yet again bare a son, and called his name Shelah: and he was at\nChezib, when she bare him.\n6 And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, and her name was Tamar.\n7 And Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah\nslew him.\n8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and perform the duty\nof a husband's brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother.\n9 And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass, when he\nwent in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he\nshould give seed to his brother.\n10 And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and he slew him\nalso.\n11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in thy father's\nhouse, till Shelah my son be grown up; for he said, Lest he also die, like his\nbrethren. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.\n12 And in process of time Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah\nwas comforted, and went up unto his sheep-shearers to Timnah, he and his friend\nHirah the Adullamite.\n13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah\nto shear his sheep.\n14 And she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself\nwith her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by\nthe way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given\nunto him to wife.\n15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; for she had covered her\nface.\n16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me come\nin unto thee: for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said,\nWhat wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?\n17 And he said, I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock. And she\nsaid, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?\n18 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet and thy\ncord, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave them to her, and came in\nunto her, and she conceived by him.\n19 And she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the\ngarments of her widowhood.\n20 And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,\nto receive the pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.\n21 Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute, that was\nat Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There hath been no prostitute here.\n22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her; and also the men of\nthe place said, There hath been no prostitute here.\n23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be put to shame: behold, I\nsent this kid, and thou hast not found her.\n24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying,\nTamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and moreover, behold, she is\nwith child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.\n25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the\nman, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose\nare these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff.\n26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She is more righteous than I,\nforasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.\n27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in\nher womb.\n28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand: and the\nmidwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out\nfirst.\n29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came\nout: and she said, Wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself? therefore his\nname was called Perez.\n30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his\nhand: and his name was called Zerah.\n\nChapter 39\n\n1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's,\nthe captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the\nIshmaelites, that had brought him down thither.\n2 And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the\nhouse of his master the Egyptian.\n3 And his master saw that Jehovah was with him, and that Jehovah made all that\nhe did to prosper in his hand.\n4 And Joseph found favor in his sight, and he ministered unto him: and he made\nhim overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.\n5 And it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and\nover all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's\nsake; and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had, in the house and in\nthe field.\n6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not aught [that was]\nwith him, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was comely, and\nwell-favored.\n7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes\nupon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.\n8 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master knoweth not\nwhat is with me in the house, and he hath put all that he hath into my hand:\n9 he is not greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back anything\nfrom me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great\nwickedness, and sin against God?\n10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not\nunto her, to lie by her, [or] to be with her.\n11 And it came to pass about this time, that he went into the house to do his\nwork; and there was none of the men of the house there within.\n12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his\ngarment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.\n13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand,\nand was fled forth,\n14 that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See,\nhe hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us: he came in unto me to lie with\nme, and I cried with a loud voice:\n15 and it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that\nhe left his garment by me, and fled, and got him out.\n16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.\n17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant,\nwhom thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:\n18 and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his\ngarment by me, and fled out.\n19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she\nspake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath\nwas kindled.\n20 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where\nthe king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.\n21 But Jehovah was with Joseph, and showed kindness unto him, and gave him favor\nin the sight of the keeper of the prison.\n22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners\nthat were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.\n23 The keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand,\nbecause Jehovah was with him; and that which he did, Jehovah made it to prosper.\n\nChapter 40\n\n1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt\nand his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt.\n2 And Pharaoh was wroth against his two officers, against the chief of the\nbutlers, and against the chief of the bakers.\n3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the\nprison, the place where Joseph was bound.\n4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he ministered unto\nthem: and they continued a season in ward.\n5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each\nman according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of\nthe king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.\n6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they\nwere sad.\n7 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in ward in his master's\nhouse, saying, Wherefore look ye so sad to-day?\n8 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can\ninterpret it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God?\ntell it me, I pray you.\n9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream,\nbehold, a vine was before me;\n10 and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, [and]\nits blossoms shot forth; [and] the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:\n11 and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them\ninto Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.\n12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: the three\nbranches are three days;\n13 within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto\nthine office: and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former\nmanner when thou wast his butler.\n14 But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and show\nkindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring\nme out of this house:\n15 for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also\nhave I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.\n16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto\nJoseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were\non my head:\n17 and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for\nPharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.\n18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: the three\nbaskets are three days;\n19 within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall\nhang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.\n20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made\na feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and\nthe head of the chief baker among his servants.\n21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the\ncup into Pharaoh's hand:\n22 but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.\n23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.\n\nChapter 41\n\n1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and,\nbehold, he stood by the river.\n2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, well-favored and\nfat-fleshed; and they fed in the reed-grass.\n3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill-favored\nand lean-fleshed, and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.\n4 And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-favored\nand fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.\n5 And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of grain came\nup upon one stalk, rank and good.\n6 And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after\nthem.\n7 And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh\nawoke, and, behold, it was a dream.\n8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent\nand called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and\nPharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto\nPharaoh.\n9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this\nday:\n10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the house of the\ncaptain of the guard, me and the chief baker:\n11 and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according\nto the interpretation of his dream.\n12 And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of\nthe guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man\naccording to his dream he did interpret.\n13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto\nmine office, and him he hanged.\n14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the\ndungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto\nPharaoh.\n15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that\ncan interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that when thou hearest a dream\nthou canst interpret it.\n16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh\nan answer of peace.\n17 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of\nthe river:\n18 and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed and\nwell-favored: and they fed in the reed-grass:\n19 and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill-favored\nand lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:\n20 and the lean and ill-favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:\n21 and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten\nthem; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.\n22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full\nand good:\n23 and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, [and] blasted with the east wind,\nsprung up after them:\n24 and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears: and I told it unto the\nmagicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.\n25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: what God is about\nto do he hath declared unto Pharaoh.\n26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years:\nthe dream is one.\n27 And the seven lean and ill-favored kine that came up after them are seven\nyears, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind; they shall be\nseven years of famine.\n28 That is the thing which I spake unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do he hath\nshowed unto Pharaoh.\n29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of\nEgypt:\n30 and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty\nshall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;\n31 and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which\nfolloweth; for it shall be very grievous.\n32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh, it is because the thing is\nestablished by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.\n33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over\nthe land of Egypt.\n34 Let Pharaoh do [this], and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take\nup the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.\n35 And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up\ngrain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.\n36 And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of\nfamine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through\nthe famine.\n37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his\nservants.\n38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in\nwhom the spirit of God is?\n39 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all of this,\nthere is none so discreet and wise as thou:\n40 thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people\nbe ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.\n41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of\nEgypt.\n42 And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's\nhand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his\nneck;\n43 and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had: and they cried\nbefore him, Bow the knee: and he set him over all the land of Egypt.\n44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man\nlift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.\n45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him to wife\nAsenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On. And Joseph went out over the\nland of Egypt.\n46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt.\nAnd Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the\nland of Egypt.\n47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.\n48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of\nEgypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was\nround about every city, laid he up in the same.\n49 And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off\nnumbering; for it was without number.\n50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom\nAsenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bare unto him.\n51 And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: For, [said he], God\nhath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.\n52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath made me fruitful\nin the land of my affliction.\n53 And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end.\n54 And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said:\nand there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.\n55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for\nbread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to\nyou, do.\n56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the\nstore-houses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land\nof Egypt.\n57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine\nwas sore in all the earth.\n\nChapter 42\n\n1 Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said unto his sons, Why\ndo ye look one upon another?\n2 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt: get you down\nthither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.\n3 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy grain from Egypt.\n4 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said,\nLest peradventure harm befall him.\n5 And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came: for the famine was\nin the land of Canaan.\n6 And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the\npeople of the land. And Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him\nwith their faces to the earth.\n7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto\nthem, and spake roughly with them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And\nthey said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.\n8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.\n9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them,\nYe are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.\n10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.\n11 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.\n12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.\n13 And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in\nthe land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and\none is not.\n14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are\nspies:\n15 hereby ye shall be proved: by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth\nhence, except your youngest brother come hither.\n16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that\nyour words may be proved, whether there be truth in you: or else by the life of\nPharaoh surely ye are spies.\n17 And he put them all together into ward three days.\n18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:\n19 if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house;\nbut go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses:\n20 and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and\nye shall not die. And they did so.\n21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in\nthat we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not\nhear; therefore is this distress come upon us.\n22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin\nagainst the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is\nrequired.\n23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter\nbetween them.\n24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and\nspake to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.\n25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every\nman's money into his sack, and to give them provisions for the way: and thus was\nit done unto them.\n26 And they laded their asses with their grain, and departed thence.\n27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the\nlodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his\nsack.\n28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in\nmy sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another,\nsaying, What is this that God hath done unto us?\n29 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him\nall that had befallen them, saying,\n30 The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies\nof the country.\n31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:\n32 we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is\nthis day with our father in the land of Canaan.\n33 And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye\nare true men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take [grain for] the\nfamine of your houses, and go your way;\n34 and bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no\nspies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye\nshall traffic in the land.\n35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's\nbundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their\nbundles of money, they were afraid.\n36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children:\nJoseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these\nthings are against me.\n37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him\nnot to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.\n38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and\nhe only is left: if harm befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye\nbring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.\n\nChapter 43\n\n1 And the famine was sore in the land.\n2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought\nout of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.\n3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us,\nsaying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.\n4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:\n5 but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down; for the man said unto us,\nYe shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.\n6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether\nye had yet a brother?\n7 And they said, The man asked straitly concerning ourselves, and concerning our\nkindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye [another] brother? and we\ntold him according to the tenor of these words: could we in any wise know that\nhe would say, Bring your brother down?\n8 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise\nand go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little\nones.\n9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him\nnot unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:\n10 for except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time.\n11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it be so now, do this: take of the\nchoice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a\nlittle balm, and a little honey, spicery and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;\n12 and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the\nmouth of your sacks carry again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:\n13 take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:\n14 and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release unto you\nyour other brother and Benjamin. And if I be bereaved of my children, I am\nbereaved.\n15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and\nBenjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.\n16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house,\nBring the men into the house, and slay, and make ready; for the men shall dine\nwith me at noon.\n17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men to Joseph's\nhouse.\n18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house; and\nthey said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time\nare we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and\ntake us for bondmen, and our asses.\n19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spake unto him\nat the door of the house,\n20 and said, Oh, my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:\n21 and it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our\nsacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in\nfull weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.\n22 And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food: we know not who\nput our money in our sacks.\n23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father,\nhath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon\nout unto them.\n24 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and\nthey washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.\n25 And they made ready the present against Joseph's coming at noon: for they\nheard that they should eat bread there.\n26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their\nhand into the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth.\n27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old\nman of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?\n28 And they said, Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive. And they\nbowed the head, and made obeisance.\n29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son,\nand said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said,\nGod be gracious unto thee, my son.\n30 And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned over his brother: and he sought\nwhere to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.\n31 And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said, Set\non bread.\n32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the\nEgyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not\neat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.\n33 And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the\nyoungest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one with another.\n34 And he took [and sent] messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess\nwas five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with\nhim. [\n\nChapter 44\n\n1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with\nfood, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.\n2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his\ngrain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.\n3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their\nasses.\n4 [ And] when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph\nsaid unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake\nthem, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?\n5 Is not this that in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye\nhave done evil in so doing.\n6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words.\n7 And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be\nit from thy servants that they should do such a thing.\n8 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto\nthee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house\nsilver or gold?\n9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be\nmy lord's bondmen.\n10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is\nfound shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless.\n11 Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened\nevery man his sack.\n12 And he searched, [and] began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and\nthe cup was found in Benjamin's sack.\n13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to\nthe city.\n14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; and he was yet there: and\nthey fell before him on the ground.\n15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not\nthat such a man as I can indeed divine?\n16 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how\nshall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants:\nbehold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is\nfound.\n17 And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the\ncup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto\nyour father.\n18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray\nthee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy\nservant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.\n19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?\n20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his\nold age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his\nmother; and his father loveth him.\n21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set\nmine eyes upon him.\n22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should\nleave his father, his father would die.\n23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down\nwith you, ye shall see my face no more.\n24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him\nthe words of my lord.\n25 And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.\n26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will\nwe go down; for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be\nwith us.\n27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two\nsons:\n28 and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I\nhave not seen him since:\n29 and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down\nmy gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.\n30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with\nus; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;\n31 it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not [with us], that he\nwill die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our\nfather with sorrow to Sheol.\n32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring\nhim not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever.\n33 Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a\nbondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.\n34 For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I see the\nevil that shall come on my father.\n\nChapter 45\n\n1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and\nhe cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him,\nwhile Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.\n2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.\n3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And\nhis brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.\n4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came\nnear. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.\n5 And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for\nGod did send me before you to preserve life.\n6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and there are yet five\nyears, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest.\n7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth, and to save\nyou alive by a great deliverance.\n8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a\nfather to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of\nEgypt.\n9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph,\nGod hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not;\n10 and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me,\nthou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy\nherds, and all that thou hast:\n11 and there will I nourish thee; for there are yet five years of famine; lest\nthou come to poverty, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast.\n12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is\nmy mouth that speaketh unto you.\n13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have\nseen: and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.\n14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept\nupon his neck.\n15 And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his\nbrethren talked with him.\n16 And the report thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's\nbrethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.\n17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye: lade your\nbeasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;\n18 and take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give\nyou the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.\n19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye: take you wagons out of the land of Egypt\nfor your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.\n20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.\n21 And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the\ncommandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.\n22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave\nthree hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.\n23 And to his father he sent after this manner: ten asses laden with the good\nthings of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with grain and bread and provision for\nhis father by the way.\n24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See\nthat ye fall not out by the way.\n25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob\ntheir father.\n26 And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the\nland of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he believed them not.\n27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and\nwhen he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob\ntheir father revived:\n28 and Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see\nhim before I die.\n\nChapter 46\n\n1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and\noffered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.\n2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob.\nAnd he said, Here am I.\n3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt;\nfor I will there make of thee a great nation:\n4 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up\nagain: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.\n5 And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their\nfather, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had\nsent to carry him.\n6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land\nof Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:\n7 his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters,\nand all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.\n8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob\nand his sons: Reuben, Jacob's first-born.\n9 And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.\n10 And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar,\nand Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.\n11 And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.\n12 And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; but Er\nand Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and\nHamul.\n13 And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron.\n14 And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.\n15 These are the sons of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his\ndaughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and\nthree.\n16 And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi,\nand Areli.\n17 And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah\ntheir sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel.\n18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these\nshe bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.\n19 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.\n20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom\nAsenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bare unto him.\n21 And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman,\nEhi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.\n22 These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were\nfourteen.\n23 And the sons of Dan: Hushim.\n24 And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.\n25 These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and\nthese she bare unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.\n26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, that came out of his loins,\nbesides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;\n27 and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls: all\nthe souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.\n28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to show the way before him unto\nGoshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.\n29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to\nGoshen; and he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his\nneck a good while.\n30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that\nthou art yet alive.\n31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up,\nand tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, who\nwere in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;\n32 and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they\nhave brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.\n33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What\nis your occupation?\n34 that ye shall say, Thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth\neven until now, both we, and our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of\nGoshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.\n\nChapter 47\n\n1 Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and\ntheir flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land\nof Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.\n2 And from among his brethren he took five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.\n3 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said\nunto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.\n4 And they said unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is\nno pasture for thy servants' flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of\nCanaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of\nGoshen.\n5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come\nunto thee:\n6 the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and\nthy brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest\nany able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.\n7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob\nblessed Pharaoh.\n8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life?\n9 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a\nhundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my\nlife, and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my\nfathers in the days of their pilgrimage.\n10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.\n11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in\nthe land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh\nhad commanded.\n12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's\nhousehold, with bread, according to their families.\n13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that\nthe land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.\n14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and\nin the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the\nmoney into Pharaoh's house.\n15 And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of\nCanaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why\nshould we die in thy presence? for [our] money faileth.\n16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if\nmoney fail.\n17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in\nexchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the\nasses: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that\nyear.\n18 And when that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said\nunto him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and\nthe herds of cattle are my lord's; there is nought left in the sight of my lord,\nbut our bodies, and our lands:\n19 wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and\nour land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give\nus seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate.\n20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold\nevery man his field, because the famine was sore upon them: and the land became\nPharaoh's.\n21 And as for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of the\nborder of Egypt even to the other end thereof.\n22 Only the land of the priests bought he not: for the priests had a portion\nfrom Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they\nsold not their land.\n23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your\nland for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.\n24 And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth\nunto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for\nyour food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.\n25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find favor in the sight of\nmy lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.\n26 And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that\nPharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone became not\nPharaoh's.\n27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gat\nthem possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.\n28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the days of Jacob,\nthe years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years.\n29 And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph,\nand said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy\nhand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray\nthee, in Egypt;\n30 but when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury\nme in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.\n31 And he said, Swear unto me: and he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself\nupon the bed's head.\n\nChapter 48\n\n1 And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph, Behold, thy\nfather is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.\n2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and\nIsrael strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.\n3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land\nof Canaan, and blessed me,\n4 and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I\nwill make of thee a company of peoples, and will give this land to thy seed\nafter thee for an everlasting possession.\n5 And now thy two sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I\ncame unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and\nSimeon, shall be mine.\n6 And thy issue, that thou begettest after them, shall be thine; they shall be\ncalled after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.\n7 And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of\nCanaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come unto Ephrath: and\nI buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).\n8 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?\n9 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me\nhere. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.\n10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he\nbrought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.\n11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God\nhath let me see thy seed also.\n12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with\nhis face to the earth.\n13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left\nhand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them\nnear unto him.\n14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who\nwas the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands\nwittingly; for Manasseh was the first-born.\n15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and\nIsaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long unto this day,\n16 the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name\nbe named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them\ngrow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.\n17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of\nEphraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from\nEphraim's head unto Manasseh's head.\n18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the\nfirst-born; put thy right hand upon his head.\n19 And his father refused, and said, I know [it], my son, I know [it] ; he also\nshall become a people, and he also shall be great: howbeit his younger brother\nshall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.\n20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God\nmake thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.\n21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God will be with you, and\nbring you again unto the land of your fathers.\n22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took\nout of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.\n\nChapter 49\n\n1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said: Gather yourselves together, that I\nmay tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days.\n2 Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; And hearken unto Israel your\nfather.\n3 Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength;\nThe pre-eminence of dignity, and the pre-eminence of power.\n4 Boiling over as water, thou shalt not have the pre-eminence; Because thou\nwentest up to thy father's bed; Then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.\n5 Simeon and Levi are brethren; Weapons of violence are their swords.\n6 O my soul, come not thou into their council; Unto their assembly, my glory, be\nnot thou united; For in their anger they slew a man, And in their self-will they\nhocked [ an ox.\n7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; And their wrath, for it was cruel: I\nwill divide them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel.\n8 Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise: Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine\nenemies; Thy father's sons shall bow down before thee.\n9 Judah is a lion's whelp; From the prey, my son, thou art gone up: He stooped\ndown, he couched as a lion, And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?\n10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler's staff from between\nhis feet, Until Shiloh come; And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be.\n11 Binding his foal unto the vine, And his ass's colt unto the choice vine; He\nhath washed his garments in wine, And his vesture in the blood of grapes:\n12 His eyes shall be red with wine, And his teeth white with milk.\n13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; And he shall be for a haven of\nships; And his border shall be upon Sidon.\n14 Issachar is a strong ass, Couching down between the sheepfolds:\n15 And he saw a resting-place that it was good, And the land that it was\npleasant; And he bowed his shoulder to bear, And became a servant under\ntaskwork.\n16 Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel.\n17 Dan shall be a serpent in the way, An adder in the path, That biteth the\nhorse's heels, So that his rider falleth backward.\n18 I have waited for thy salvation, O Jehovah.\n19 Gad, a troop shall press upon him; But he shall press upon their heel.\n20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, And he shall yield royal dainties.\n21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: He giveth goodly words.\n22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a fountain; His branches run\nover the wall.\n23 The archers have sorely grieved him, And shot at him, and persecuted him:\n24 But his bow abode in strength, And the arms of his hands were made strong, By\nthe hands of the Mighty One of Jacob (From thence is the shepherd, the stone of\nIsrael), [\n25 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, And by the Almighty, who\nshall bless thee, With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that\ncoucheth beneath, Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.\n26 The blessings of thy father Have prevailed above the blessings of my\nprogenitors Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: They shall be on the\nhead of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his\nbrethren.\n27 Benjamin is a wolf that raveneth: In the morning he shall devour the prey,\nAnd at even he shall divide the spoil.\n28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father\nspake unto them and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed\nthem.\n29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people:\nbury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,\n30 in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the\nland of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for\na possession of a burying-place.\n31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and\nRebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah--\n32 the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children\nof Heth.\n33 And when Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into\nthe bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.\n\nChapter 50\n\n1 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.\n2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the\nphysicians embalmed Israel.\n3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of\nembalming: and the Egyptians wept for him three-score and ten days.\n4 And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spake unto the house of\nPharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in\nthe ears of Pharaoh, saying,\n5 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged\nfor me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go\nup, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.\n6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.\n7 And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants\nof Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,\n8 and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only\ntheir little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of\nGoshen.\n9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great\ncompany.\n10 And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and\nthere they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation: and he made a\nmourning for his father seven days.\n11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the\nfloor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians:\nwherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.\n12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:\n13 for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave\nof the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession\nof a burying-place, of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.\n14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up\nwith him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.\n15 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, It may\nbe that Joseph will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil which we did\nunto him.\n16 And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he\ndied, saying,\n17 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of\nthy brethren, and their sin, for that they did unto thee evil. And now, we pray\nthee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And\nJoseph wept when they spake unto him.\n18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said,\nBehold, we are thy servants.\n19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?\n20 And as for you, ye meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring\nto pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.\n21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he\ncomforted them, and spake kindly unto them.\n22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived a\nhundred and ten years.\n23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also\nof Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph's knees.\n24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die; but God will surely visit you, and\nbring you up out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac,\nand to Jacob.\n25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely\nvisit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.\n26 So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and\nhe was put in a coffin in Egypt.", 'cache_name': 'cachedContents/8si754phc4uv', 'messages': [HumanMessage(content='Create a cache for the Genesis book.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='8fea8e4a-8e24-4a46-a326-f1d1b9e1537b'), AIMessage(content="To create a cache for the Book of Genesis, we can summarize its key themes, stories, and characters.

And she went to inquire of Jehovah.\n23 And Jehovah said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels: And the one people shall be stronger than the other people; And the elder shall serve the younger.\n24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.\n25 And the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.\n26 And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.\n27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.\n28 Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: and Rebekah loved Jacob.\n29 And Jacob boiled pottage: and Esau came in from the field, and he was faint:\n30 and Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red [pottage] ; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.\n31 And Jacob said, Sell me first thy birthright.\n32 And Esau said, Behold, I am about to die: and what profit shall the birthright do to me?\n33 And Jacob said, Swear to me first; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.\n34 And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: so Esau despised his birthright. \n"}
